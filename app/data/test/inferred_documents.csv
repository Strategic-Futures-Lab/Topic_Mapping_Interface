"111","Energy spectra of finite temperature superfluid helium-4 turbulence","A mesoscopic model of finite temperature superfluid helium-4 based on coupled Langevin-Navier-Stokes dynamics is proposed. Drawing upon scaling arguments and available numerical results, a numerical method for designing well resolved, mesoscopic calculations of finite temperature superfluid turbulence is developed. The application of model and numerical method to the problem of fully developed turbulence decay in helium II, indicates that the spectral structure of normal-fluid and superfluid turbulence is significantly more complex than that of turbulence in simple-fluids. Analysis based on a forced flow of helium-4 at 1.3 K, where viscous dissipation in the normal-fluid is compensated by the Lundgren force, indicate three scaling regimes in the normal-fluid, that include the inertial, low wavenumber, Kolmogorov k?5/3 regime, a sub-turbulence, low Reynolds number, fluctuating k?2.2 regime, and an intermediate, viscous k?6 range that connects the two. The k?2.2 regime is due to normal-fluid forcing by superfluid vortices at high wavenumbers. There are also three scaling regimes in the superfluid, that include a k?3 range that corresponds to the growth of superfluid vortex instabilities due to mutual-friction action, and an adjacent, low wavenumber, k?5/3 regime that emerges during the termination of this growth, as superfluid vortices agglomerate between intense normal-fluid vorticity regions, and weakly polarized bundles are formed. There is also evidence of a high wavenumber k?1 range that corresponds to the probing of individual-vortex velocity fields. The Kelvin waves cascade (the main dynamical effect in zero temperature superfluids) appears to be damped at the intervortex space scale.","D","592","H & L","28/11/17","154","true","","0.2626","0.0013","3.0E-4","0.0173","3.0E-4","0.0024","0.0239","5.0E-4","0.1183","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.3078","0.026","0.2316","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0056","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.235","0.0375","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0438","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2219","0.0033","1.0E-4","0.002","3.0E-4","0.0064","0.0011","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0201","2.0E-4","0.2698","0.0443","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0479","0.0012","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0296","1.0E-4","0.0057","0.0146","0.001","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0062","1.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"112","R-matrix electron-impact excitation data for the Mg-like iso-electronic sequence","Emission lines from ions in the Mg-like iso-electronic sequence can be used as reliable diagnostics of temperature and density of astrophysical and fusion plasmas over a wide range of parameters. Data in the literature are quite lacking, there are no calculations for many of the ions in the sequence. We have carried-out intermediate coupling frame transformation R-matrix calculations which include a total of 283 fine-structure levels in both the configuration interaction target and close-coupling collision expansions. These arise from the configurations 1s2 2s2 2p6 3 {s,p,d} nl with n = 4,5, and for l = 0−4. We obtain ordinary collision strengths and Maxwell-averaged effective collision strengths for the electron-impact excitation of all the ions of the Mg-like sequence, from Al+ to Zn18 +. We compare our results with those from previous R-matrix and distorted waves calculations, where available, for some benchmark ions. We find good agreement with the results of previous calculations for the transitions n = 3−3. We also find good agreement for the most intense transitions n = 3−4. These transitions are important for populating the upper levels of the main diagnostic lines.","E","102","D","18/02/16","103","true","","0.5366","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0041","3.0E-4","0.0022","9.0E-4","0.0021","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0029","8.0E-4","0.0055","0.4407","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.5122","3.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.414","0.0014","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0118","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.046","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"113","Effect of cultured rat primary hepatocytes on the mechanical properties of collagen gel matrices","Collagen gels are widely used as matrices for in vitro cell culture and also for a variety of tissue engineering applications. The mechanical properties of matrices have been shown to be important parameters which greatly influence cell
behaviour. For successful support of long term cell growth and function, it is important for matrices to retain their mechanical integrity during the period of use. The presence of cells has been shown to alter matrix properties. The aim of this

"114","The law of transboundary aquifers: many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still","The international community has been considering international legal norms and policies for the management of transboundary aquifers for more than ten years. In 2008, the  International Law Commission provided a framework with the adoption of the Draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers, which are now formally annexed to a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution. Since 2008, the topic of the law of transboundary aquifers has thrice been placed on the agenda of the UNGA Sixth Committee with a specific mandate to discuss the future form of the Draft Articles. This article explores the options before the international community regarding the future form of the Draft Articles and considers the possible advantages and disadvantages of each option. The article also discusses the extent to which the actual form of the Draft Articles matters in itself, or whether the impact of the Draft Articles ultimately will depend on other factors.","B","814","B & E","20/07/19","79","true","","0.0028","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.2196","0.0693","0.0014","0.0014","0.0014","0.0067","0.0088","0.001","0.5485","0.0736","0.0241","0.0015","0.0016","0.0175","0.0196","6.0E-4","0.0018","0.0128","0.0036","0.0024","7.0E-4","0.0041","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","0.0329","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.136","5.0E-4","0.0031","0.0029","2.0E-4","0.1639","0.0018","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0014","0.5932","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0241","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"115","New civil engineer: introducing undergraduate civil engineers to construction technology","Undergraduate (UG) civil engineering students should graduate from university with knowledge that links their computational competence in structural engineering and mechanics to construction technology principles, processes and practice. However, there appears to be a paucity of evidence to suggest that UG civil engineering students receive sufficient instruction in construction technology throughout their degree studies. This paper presents evidence from a study employing the weekly New Civil Engineer (NCE) publication as a vehicle for introducing construction technology to first year students. The results reveal that students found this publication interesting and inspirational.
Whilst this innovative approach to teaching construction technology would be best ‘blended’ throughout the UG course, its introduction, application and success arguably requires a multi-disciplinary and carefully ‘engineered’ approach. Given the diversity of academic staff, individual motivation and the professional demands of a contemporary mass higher education system, the prospective benefits from ‘blended’ learning in UG construction technology studies will in all probability remain unfulfilled.","A","637","E & F","10/12/18","106","true","","7.0E-4","0.0013","0.0023","6.0E-4","0.0154","0.375","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0025","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0019","0.2297","0.3014","3.0E-4","0.0078","0.0032","0.0042","0.0505","0.0011","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0022","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.0023","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0019","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2095","0.0011","5.0E-4","0.2139","2.0E-4","0.0676","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0286","0.0022","0.3023","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0155","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0099","3.0E-4","0.0755","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0037","7.0E-4","0.0481","3.0E-4"

It was found that an improvement in output power could be obtained by using etalons to limit the fundamental spectrum to a single narrow peak.","B","341","M & I","24/09/15","51","true","","0.25","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0012","7.0E-4","0.0459","0.3807","9.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.001","0.0044","0.3071","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.002","0.002","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1891","0.0131","0.0011","2.0E-4","0.1307","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.001","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2822","0.0011","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2725","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0935","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0016","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"118","Towards human-oriented norms: investigating the effects of noise exposure on board ships","With current trends showing a decrease in crew numbers on board ships together with increased operational demands as well as increased paperwork, crew fatigue and comfort has become more critical and recently been given more importance. It is known that environmental factors have an effect on crew comfort and performance. The two outstanding environmental factors which exist in the shipboard environment are ship motions and noise, moreover, in these two areas the findings and lessons learnt from other industrial sectors are considered to be less relevant. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct research to understand the effects of these factors, so that, the lessons learnt can be integrated into design process in order to eliminate the adverse effects of the aforementioned two factors during operation. Due to having more obvious performance outcomes ship motions and motion sickness research attracted more interest where human response to noise have been neglected so far. Therefore, this paper reports the findings of research study which investigated the current levels of crew noise exposure through field studies. Furthermore, developed human response models to noise on board ships and SILENV green label noise standards will also be introduced in comparison with current normative framework.","B","683","B & L","23/02/18","113","true","","5.0E-4","0.0046","0.0126","0.0103","0.0878","0.1012","6.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0021","0.0096","0.2459","0.4223","3.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","0.0454","0.0543","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0364","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0147","0.0268","8.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0198","2.0E-4","0.003","0.0048","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0376","0.2915","0.0066","7.0E-4","0.0452","0.0019","0.0039","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3079","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","0.1043","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0056","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0668","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0122"

This multi-purpose research facility is initially aimed at promoting three major goals: (1) Short electron bunches for ultra-fast science. (2) Construction of a plasma accelerator module with useable beam quality (3) Setup of an attosecond radiation source with advanced technology. Research and development on these topics is presently ongoing at various places at DESY, as add-on experiments at operational facilities. The two research goals are intimately connected: short bunches and precise femtosecond timing are requirements for developing a plasma accelerator module with external injection or staging. The scientific case of a dedicated facility for accelerator research at DESY is discussed. Further options are mentioned, like the use of a 1 GeV beam from Linac II for FEL studies. The presently planned conversion of the DORIS accelerator and its central halls into the SINBAD facility is described. The available space will allow setting up several independent experiments with a cost-effective use of the same infrastructure(for example a central high power laser, a central timing and synchronization lab, etc.). National and international contributions and proposals can be envisaged. A preliminary, possible layout and the design work plan are discussed.","C","564","L & K & C","17/09/15","127","true","","0.3088","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0041","0.0019","5.0E-4","0.003","0.0707","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2411","0.3505","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","0.0145","3.0E-4","0.1209","0.001","4.0E-4","0.0089","0.0037","0.2853","0.0218","6.0E-4","0.002","0.0018","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0056","0.0061","8.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2415","0.0026","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0036","2.0E-4","0.2435","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0243","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0108","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0069","7.0E-4"

In particular, we clarify the relation between roots of the cosine function and the limit of the alternated series whose terms are the inverse of odd natural numbers (known as Leibnitz' formula).We give a formal description of the arctangent function and its expansion as a power series.  We then study other possible descriptions of pi, first as the surface of the unit disk, second as the limit of perimeters of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides.In a third section, we concentrate on techniques to effectively compute approximations of pi in the proof assistant by relying on rational numbers and decimal representations.","D","723","A & D","24/08/19","65","true","","0.0023","0.0069","6.0E-4","0.0071","0.0042","0.0747","0.0218","0.0035","0.0041","0.0021","9.0E-4","0.0029","0.0119","0.6675","9.0E-4","0.166","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0216","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0013","0.0018","0.0142","6.0E-4","0.0033","0.0036","0.0106","8.0E-4","0.0791","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0152","0.0035","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0017","8.0E-4","0.0348","0.0025","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.6273","0.0104","6.0E-4","0.0311","2.0E-4","0.0089","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.0285","0.0134","0.0551","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0054","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0053","0.031","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"12","Shrinking wings for ultrasonic pitch production: hyperintense ultra-short-wavelength calls in a new genus of neotropical katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae)","This article reports the discovery of a new genus and three species of predaceous katydid (Insecta: Orthoptera) from Colombia and Ecuador in which males produce the highest frequency ultrasonic calling songs so far recorded from an arthropod. Male katydids sing by rubbing their wings together to attract distant females. Their song frequencies usually range from audio (5 kHz) to low ultrasonic (30 kHz). However, males of Supersonus spp. call females at 115 kHz, 125 kHz, and 150 kHz. Exceeding the human hearing range (50 Hz–20 kHz) by an order of magnitude, these insects also emit their ultrasound at unusually elevated sound pressure levels (SPL). In all three species these calls exceed 110 dB SPL rms re 20 µPa (at 15 cm). Males of Supersonus spp. have unusually reduced forewings (<0.5 mm2). Only the right wing radiates appreciable sound, the left bears the file and does not show a particular resonance. In contrast to most katydids, males of Supersonus spp. position and move their wings during sound production so that the concave aspect of the right wing, underlain by the insect dorsum, forms a contained cavity with sharp resonance. The observed high SPL at extreme carrier frequencies can be explained by wing anatomy, a resonant cavity with a membrane, and cuticle deformation.","E","428","F & L & B","02/05/19","134","true","","0.0579","0.0429","0.1287","0.0045","0.0075","0.002","0.3223","0.0941","0.0232","8.0E-4","0.007","0.002","0.0228","0.1058","4.0E-4","0.0067","0.0048","0.0011","0.0713","0.0952","0.088","0.0072","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0229","0.0021","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.088","0.0014","4.0E-4","0.0017","0.0012","0.1229","0.0013","0.0272","0.0196","0.0011","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0079","2.0E-4","0.1524","0.0101","0.019","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0013","0.1115","0.0148","2.0E-4","0.0041","0.0347","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","0.1229","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1192","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0037","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.004","4.0E-4","0.0015","0.0034"
"13","Fibronectin module FNIII9 adsorption at contrasting solid model surfaces studied by atomistic molecular dynamics","The mechanism of human fibronectin adhesion synergy region (known as integrin binding region) in repeat 9 (FNIII9) domain adsorption at pH 7 onto various and contrasting model surfaces has been studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We use an ionic model to mimic mica surface charge density but without a long-range electric field above the surface, a silica model with a long-range electric field similar to that found experimentally, and an Au {111} model with no partial charges or electric field. A detailed description of the adsorption processes and the contrasts between the various model surfaces is provided. In the case of our model silica surface with a long-range electrostatic field, the adsorption is rapid and primarily driven by electrostatics. Because it is negatively charged (?1e), FN III9 readily adsorbs to a positively charged surface. However, due to its partial charge distribution, FNIII9 can also adsorb to the negatively charged mica model because of the absence of a long-range repulsive electric field. The protein dipole moment dictates its contrasting orientation at these surfaces, and the anchoring residues have opposite charges to the surface. Adsorption on the model Au {111} surface is possible, but less specific, and various protein regions might be involved in the interactions with the surface. Despite strongly influencing the protein mobility, adsorption at these model surfaces does not require wholesale FNIII9 conformational changes, which suggests that the biological activity of the adsorbed protein might be preserved.","A","449","E","08/10/15","148","true","","0.2591","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0013","0.098","0.0045","0.0276","3.0E-4","0.1383","0.0587","0.0035","0.4032","6.0E-4","0.0019","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.204","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0196","0.0011","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0318","0.0022","2.0E-4","0.0169","0.005","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1545","2.0E-4","0.3807","0.0019","9.0E-4","0.0012","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0304","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0056","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0446","0.0024","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0902","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"

The Performance Index measures recent economic success; the Attractiveness Index measures how well a region is an attractive location to companies and highly-qualified individuals; and the Structural Potential Index estimates future potential economic growth based on current economic structure. The application of the IB Index Family provides a first-step into a more in-depth benchmarking of the competitiveness of a region, which is necessary when working towards detailed policy conclusions.

Patients with asthma who were naïve to previous long-acting β agonist therapy and initiated combination inhaler therapy in 2008–2009 were classified according to the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose in their combination inhaler compared with the highest dose of ICS they received before initiation. Among the 685 patients (541 (79.0%) who had been prescribed an ICS previously), those originally on low-, medium- or high-dose ICS were changed to high-dose combination therapy in 122/250 (48.8%), 94/151 (62.3%) or 85/113 (75.2%) cases in each ICS dose category, respectively. These results suggest that evaluation of appropriate high-dose ICS prescribing in general practice is needed.","B","909","L","11/06/16","80","true","","0.0015","0.266","0.2314","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0345","8.0E-4","0.0019","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0128","6.0E-4","0.0336","0.1805","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","0.2321","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.4062","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0168","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.3082","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0032","0.0276","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","0.127","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0947","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"18","Lymphocyte-mediated neuroprotection in in vitro models of excitotoxicity involves astrocytic activation and the inhibition of MAP kinase signalling pathways","It is well established that immunosurveillance is active in the CNS and plays a key role in several CNS disorders but the exact role of immune cells remains elusive. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether lymphocytes are protective/detrimental in in vitro models of excitotoxicty. Kainate (KA)-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced following exposure to mixed lymphocytes or purified T lymphocytes containing either activated or non-activated T-lymphocytes. Conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations, but not boiled conditioned media, was protective against KA-induced toxicity indicating soluble mediators underlie the observed neuroprotection with cytokine arrays indicating IL-16 as the likely candidate. A role for astrocytes was established as the neuroprotection was abolished in the presence of the glial toxin, fluoroacetate. Furthermore, lymphocytes inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways with pharmacological inhibition of these pathways mimicking the protective effect of lymphocytes. Similarly, lymphocytes were neuroprotective against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death with the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways involved. These data indicate that lymphocytes are neuroprotective under our experimental conditions and we suggest that astrocytic activation and inhibition of MAPK signalling cascades are involved but further studies are required to investigate whether similar mechanisms underlie the actions of lymphocytes in in vivo experimental models of disease.

"120","The Impacts of Temporary and Anticipated Tourism Spending","Part of the local economic impact of a major sporting event comes from the associated temporary tourism expenditures. Typically demand-driven Input-Output (IO) methods are used to quantify the impacts of such expenditures. However, IO modelling has specific weaknesses when measuring temporary tourism impacts; particular problems lie in its treatment of factor supplies and its lack of dynamics. Recent work argues that Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis is more appropriate and this has been widely applied. Neglected in this literature however is an understanding of the role that behavioural characteristics and factor supply assumptions play in determining the economic impact of tourist expenditures, particularly where expenditures are temporary (i.e. of limited duration) and anticipated (i.e. known in advance). This paper uses a CGE model for Scotland in which agents can have myopic- or forward-looking behaviours and shows how these alternative specifications affect the timing and scale of the economic impacts from anticipated and temporary tourism expenditure. The tourism shock analysed is of a scale expected for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Glasgow in 2014. The model shows how “pre-shock” and “legacy” effects – impacts before and after the shock – arise and their quantitative importance. Using the forward-looking model the paper calculates the optimal degree of pre-announcement.","A","301","A & G","29/07/17","120","true","","0.0054","0.1136","0.002","0.0379","0.0642","0.0148","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0055","0.0092","0.4144","0.3277","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0025","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.0021","0.0041","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0306","0.1558","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0091","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3274","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0098","0.2117","2.0E-4","0.0742","0.0011","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0021","0.0916","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0617","0.0093"

"121","Enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of anticancer agent by cytochrome C functionalised hybrid nanoparticles in hepatocellular cancer cells","Treatment of hepatocellular cancer with chemotherapeutic agents has limited success in clinical practice and their efficient IC50 concentration would require extremely high doses of drug administration which could not be tolerated due to systemic side effects. In order to potentiate the efficacy of anticancer agents we explored the potential of co-treatment with pro-apoptotic Cytochrome c which activates the apoptotic pathway downstream of p53 that is frequently mutated in cancer. To this end we used hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles as a drug delivery system to facilitate the internalisation of Cytochrome c into cultured HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results showed that Cytochrome c can be easily conjugated to the gold shell of the nanoparticles which are readily taken up by the cells. We used Cytochrome c in concentration (0.2µgmL-1) below the threshold required to induce apoptosis on its own. When the conjugate was administered to cells treated by doxorubicin, it significantly reduced its IC50 concentration from 9µgmL-1 to 3.5µgmL-1 as detected by cell viability assay, and the efficiency of doxorubicin on decreasing viability of HepG2 cells was significantly enhanced in the lower concentration range between 0.01µgmL-1 to 5µgmL-1. The results demonstrate the potential of the application of therapeutic proteins in activating the apoptotic pathway to complement conventional chemotherapy to increase its efficacy. The application of hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles can also augment the specificity of drug targeting and could serve as a model drug delivery system for pro-apoptotic protein targeting and delivery.","D","692","H & L","25/10/16","150","true","","0.0111","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0024","3.0E-4","0.0028","0.0065","0.0037","3.0E-4","0.0136","0.6126","7.0E-4","0.0424","0.1928","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.042","0.0042","0.0631","0.001","0.3017","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0173","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.073","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0035","0.0014","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0014","0.146","0.0026","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1006","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.3131","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0227","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0019","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","0.0029","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"1","The Effects of Financial Development on Foreign Direct Investment","This paper examines how financial development influences foreign direct investment. The direct and indirect sector-specific effects that source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development can have on foreign direct investment are first identified in a conceptual framework. The presence and relative strength of these various channels of influence at the different margins of foreign direct investment are then empirically investigated using unique and underexploited sector-specific bilateral panel data on greenfield foreign direct investment over the period 2003-2006. Causality is established by applying a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the variation in financial vulnerability across manufacturing sectors. The overall effects of higher source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development on the relative volume of bilateral foreign direct investment in financially vulnerable sectors are large, positive, and complementary. These effects appear to operate mainly at the intensive margin rather than at the extensive margin of foreign direct investment. There is also evidence of direct and indirect effects of financial development. The key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral Mergers\&Acquisitions transactions. Overall, the empirical results unambiguously indicate that a sophisticated and well-functioning financial system in source and destination countries greatly facilitates the international expansion of firms through foreign direct investment, especially in financially vulnerable sectors.","B","784","E & F & G","05/12/18","135","true","","7.0E-4","0.0031","4.0E-4","0.0428","0.0451","0.0428","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0015","0.001","0.5393","0.3166","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0016","0.0017","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0027","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0012","0.0012","0.0421","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0162","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3263","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1442","1.0E-4","0.0024","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0029","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0014","7.0E-4","0.448"

"2","Collective thinking about the future? A study of three citizens’ juries on wind farms in Scotland","Mini-publics are the most lauded device for institutionalising deliberative democracy, and citizens’ juries have been the most used type. They are seen as an opportunity for citizens to deliberate on important and contentious issues, and to revise their preferences in light of deliberation. This paper analyses three Citizens’ juries conducted in different locations in Scotland on the contested topic of onshore wind farms. The locations were selected according to proximity to windfarms, and the three juries were held successively from September 2013 to February 2014. Although part of a research project, the citizens’ juries were nonetheless designed to inform Scottish policy debate about both wind farm development and public involvement in decision making on this topic. Over two days, the jurors addressed, together, the following question: ‘What should be the key principles for deciding about wind farm development, and why?’ Accordingly, the jurors were invited to engage with long-term considerations regarding policy, energy generation and climate change. Using findings from mixed methods research, this paper reflects on the extent to which the citizens’ juries were ‘thinking about the future’, and the potential of democratic innovations to counter short-term thinking in policy and decision-making.","C","508","H","25/09/17","112","true","","0.0011","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0296","0.2548","0.0014","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0013","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.4403","0.125","0.1327","7.0E-4","0.001","4.0E-4","0.0091","3.0E-4","0.002","3.0E-4","0.0685","0.0013","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0022","0.1574","1.0E-4","0.0016","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0052","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0181","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1324","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0611","1.0E-4","0.0022","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0353","0.4917","1.0E-4","0.0079","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0029"
"123","Time scale analysis of receptor enzyme activity: irreversible inhibition sometimes exhibits incubation-time independence","At early drug discovery, purified protein-based assays are often used to characterise compound potency. As far as dose response is concerned, it is often thought that a time-independent inhibitor is reversible and a time-dependent inhibitor is irreversible. Using a simple kinetics model, we investigate the legitimacy of this. Our model-based analytical analysis and numerical studies reveal that dose response of an irreversible inhibitor may appear time-independent under certain parametric conditions. Hence, time-independence cannot be used as evidence for inhibitor reversibility. Furthermore, we also analysed how the synthesis and degradation of a target receptor affect drug inhibition in an in vitro cell-based assay setting. Indeed, these processes may also influence dose response of an irreversible inhibitor in such a way that it appears time-independent under certain conditions. Hence, time-independent dose response in a cell assay also needs careful considerations. It is necessary to formulate a suitable model for analysis of protein-based assay and in vitro cell assay data to ensure a consistent understanding.","C","105","C","13/06/19","102","true","","0.0116","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0017","0.0334","6.0E-4","0.0011","0.0086","0.0017","0.4921","0.0097","0.0125","0.4227","4.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0013","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0061","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1111","0.0023","0.0062","2.0E-4","0.0058","0.0111","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0027","0.0017","0.0173","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3452","0.0032","0.0241","5.0E-4","0.0148","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.3556","0.0021","0.003","0.0137","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0502","2.0E-4","0.0144","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"3","Coupling stochastic methods and detailed dynamic simulation programs for model calibration: two preliminary case studies","Dynamic simulation programs for energy modelling have reached a high level of detail and accuracy in representing the main phenomena that determine energy performances of buildings. Many of these programs have been subjected to numerous validation studies which have demonstrated their capability of representing reality adequately if the correct inputs are available. However, that is rarely the case and often many input variables are unknown or subject to high uncertainty making predictions quite different from reality.
To overcome this issue, probabilistic models can be used, in order to learn from field data and use such updated knowledge to improve physical models. This
work proposes a framework to apply such concept and shows some interesting and promising results for two simple preliminary case studies.","D","778","I & J","06/06/16","78","true","","0.0077","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1018","9.0E-4","0.001","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0043","0.1167","0.719","6.0E-4","0.0016","8.0E-4","0.0391","0.0037","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0162","3.0E-4","0.0303","8.0E-4","0.0016","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.001","4.0E-4","0.0058","0.0011","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0054","0.0014","4.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","0.6405","5.0E-4","0.0018","0.0212","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","0.0042","0.0287","0.1038","0.0073","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.0317","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","0.0011","0.0435","3.0E-4","0.0373","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0027","0.0013","7.0E-4"
"124","Supporting exploratory video retrieval tasks with grouping and recommendation","In this paper, we present ViGOR (Video Grouping, Organisation and Recommendation), an exploratory video retrieval system. Exploratory video retrieval tasks are hampered by the lack of semantics associated to video and the overwhelming amount of video items stored in these types of collections (e.g. YouTube, MSN video, etc.). In order to help facilitate these exploratory video search tasks we present a system that utilises two complementary approaches: the first a new search paradigm that allows the semantic grouping of videos and the second the exploitation of past usage history in order to provide video recommendations. We present two types of recommendation techniques adapted to the grouping search paradigm: the first is a global recommendation, which couples the multi-faceted nature of explorative video retrieval tasks with the current user need of information in order to provide recommendations, and second is a local recommendation, which exploits the organisational features of ViGOR in order to provide more localised recommendations based on a specific aspect of the user task. Two user evaluations were carried out in order to (1) validate the new search paradigm provided by ViGOR, characterised by the grouping functionalities and (2) evaluate the usefulness of the proposed recommendation approaches when integrated into ViGOR. The results of our evaluations show (1) that the grouping, organisational and recommendation functionalities can result in an improvement in the users’ search performance without adversely impacting their perceptions of the system and (2) that both recommendation approaches are relevant to the users at different stages of their search, showing the importance of using multi-faceted recommendations for video retrieval systems and also illustrating the many uses of collaborative recommendations for exploratory video search tasks.","E","158","B & E","09/08/18","156","true","","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0026","0.2899","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","0.0483","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0802","0.3522","2.0E-4","0.0017","0.206","3.0E-4","0.0139","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0412","0.0953","0.0676","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3051","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0058","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3614","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1133","1.0E-4","0.0016","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"4","Operability assessment of high speed passenger ships based on human comfort criteria","The growing popularity of passenger cruise lines means continual challenges are faced concerning both a vessel׳s design and its operational ability. Vessel dimensions, service speeds and performance rates are rapidly increasing to keep pace with this expanding interest. It is essential that vessels demonstrate high performances, even in adverse sea and weather conditions, and ensure the comfort of passengers and the safety of cargo. A vessel׳s operability can be defined as the percentage of time in which the vessel is capable of performing her tasks securely. In order to calculate a vessel׳s operability index, many key parameters are required. These include the dynamic responses of the ship to regular waves, the wave climate of the sea around the ship׳s route, and the assigned missions of the vessel. This paper presents a procedure to calculate the operability index of a ship using seakeeping analyses. A discussion of the sensitivity of the results relative to three different employed seakeeping methods is then given. The effect of seasonality on a ship׳s estimated operability is also investigated using wave scatter diagrams. Finally, a high speed catamaran ferry is explored as a case study and its operability is assessed with regards to human comfort criteria.","E","627","K & L & M","14/08/15","120","true","","0.0186","9.0E-4","0.0016","0.0064","6.0E-4","0.0146","0.0013","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0085","7.0E-4","0.0049","0.0644","0.5862","0.0586","0.1856","0.002","6.0E-4","0.0422","0.0026","0.0038","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0068","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.073","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2577","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0034","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.0023","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.5098","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0049","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1179","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0074","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0014","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"125","Physical activity, diet and BMI in children aged 6–8 years: a cross-sectional analysis","Objective To assess relationships between current physical activity (PA), dietary intake and body mass index (BMI) in English children.  Longitudinal birth cohort study in northeast England, cross-sectional analysis.  Participants 425 children (41% of the original cohort) aged 6–8 years (49% boys).  Main outcome measures PA over 7 days was measured objectively by an accelerometer; three categories of PA were created: ‘active’ ≥60 min/day moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA); ‘moderately active’ 30–59 min/day MVPA; ‘inactive’ <30 min/day MVPA. Dietary intake over 4 days was measured using a prospective dietary assessment tool which incorporated elements of the food diary and food frequency methods. Three diet categories were created: ‘healthy’, ‘unhealthy’ and ‘mixed’, according to the number of portions of different foods consumed. Adherence to the ‘5-a-day’ recommendations for portions of fruit and vegetables was also assessed. Children were classified as ‘healthy weight’ or ‘overweight or obese’ (OW/OB) according to International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints for BMI. Associations between weight status and PA/diet categories were analysed using logistic regression.  Few children met the UK-recommended guidelines for either MVPA or fruit and vegetable intake, with just 7% meeting the recommended amount of MVPA of 60 min/day, and 3% meeting the 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation. Higher PA was associated with a lower OR for OW/OB in boys only (0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88). There was no association detected between dietary intake and OW/OB in either sex.  Increasing MVPA may help to reduce OW/OB in boys; however, more research is required to examine this relationship in girls. Children are not meeting the UK guidelines for diet and PA, and more needs to be done to improve this situation.","D","790","E & F","24/03/19","179","true","","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.5521","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1488","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0275","0.0617","0.001","4.0E-4","0.0553","3.0E-4","0.0024","0.1473","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0317","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.002","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0017","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1333","0.064","0.0014","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.016","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1282","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0013","0.0266","0.001","3.0E-4","0.5565","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.003","0.024","0.0023","1.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"5","Combating desertification in central Asia: finding new ways to regional stability through environmental sustainability?","This article appraises the Central Asian Countries' Initiative on Land Management (CACILM) as an innovative experience of regional cooperation to implement the Convention on Desertification. Despite high initial expectations, the actual implementation process has suffered drawbacks. The Central Asian countries' commitment and capacity to sustain this process depends heavily on international support. Moreover, the process' low political profile and the weak capacities of the Central Asian authorities to engage in meaningful transnational cooperation are significant hurdles to be tackled. At the same time, national and regional efforts to combat soil degradation and desertification have not yet been properly mainstreamed with other more consolidated processes for the sustainable management of natural resources, such as the IFAS. It is argued that this may be a possible solution for the future of CACILM.","B","423","M & A","10/03/17","81","true","","0.0018","0.0068","8.0E-4","0.0033","0.0068","0.0173","0.0012","0.0029","0.0106","5.0E-4","0.0013","0.0017","0.6065","0.2316","0.0011","0.0998","0.0024","0.001","0.003","4.0E-4","0.0013","4.0E-4","0.0038","0.0037","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0039","0.0042","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0031","0.0086","9.0E-4","0.0016","7.0E-4","0.0014","0.0044","3.0E-4","0.0128","5.0E-4","0.0041","4.0E-4","0.0012","0.1887","0.0011","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0029","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0016","4.0E-4","0.6211","4.0E-4","0.1063","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0075","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0045","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015"
"126","High speed differential protection for smart DC distribution systems","This paper presents a high speed current differential implementation approach for smart dc distribution systems capable of sub-millisecond fault detection. The approach utilizes the natural characteristics of dc differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times compared to standard applications and hence meet requirements for dc converter protection (around 2ms). Analysis is first developed to help quantify protection implementation challenges for a given dc system. Options for implementing the proposed technique are then illustrated. Results of scaled hardware testing are presented which validate the overall protection operating times in a low voltage environment. These results show the implementation approach can consistently achieve protection system operating within the order of a few microseconds.","B","108","F & K","14/04/17","83","true","","6.0E-4","0.0013","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.002","0.0013","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0026","0.5842","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.4019","3.0E-4","0.0029","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0494","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0072","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.016","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.4983","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0092","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4055","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"

In such scenarios, t he application of accurate, automated human tracking offers benefits over manual supervision. In this paper, recent efforts made to investigate the improvement of automated human detection and tracking techniques through the recognition
of person-specific time-varying signatures in thermal video are detailed. A robust human detection algorithm is developed to aid the initialisation stage of a state-of-the art existing tracking algorithm. In addition, coupled with the spatial tracking methods present in this algorithm, the inclusion of temporal signature recognition in the tracking process is shown to improve human tracking results.","C","657","M & I","07/05/18","78","true","","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0034","0.0011","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0061","0.1575","8.0E-4","0.0388","0.5077","5.0E-4","0.0045","0.0977","0.1763","0.0019","8.0E-4","0.0037","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0026","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0034","5.0E-4","0.008","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0032","0.0247","0.2665","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4846","0.0064","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0019","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0886","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0024","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0915","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"7","A CFD analysis of the dynamics of a direct-operated safety relief valve mounted on a pressure vessel","In this study, a numerical model is developed to investigate the fluid and dynamic characteristics of a direct-operated safety relieve valve (SRV). The CFX code has been used to employ advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques including moving mesh capabilities, multiple domains and valve
piston motion using the CFX Expression Language (CEL). With a geometrically accurate CFD model of the SRV and the vessel, the complete transient process of the system from valve opening to valve closure is simulated. A detailed picture of the compressible fluid flowing through the SRV is obtained, including
small-scale flow features in the seat regions. In addition, the flow forces on the disc and the lift are monitored and analyzed and the comparison of the effects of design parameters, are examined; including the adjusting ring position, vessel volume and spring stiffness. Results from the model allow the fluid and
dynamic characteristics of the SRV to be investigated and shows that the model has great potential of assisting engineers in the preliminary design of SRVs, operating under actual conditions which are often found to be difficult to interpret in practice.","A","103","B & C & D","24/04/18","119","true","","5.0E-4","0.0041","0.0013","0.0016","3.0E-4","0.0223","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0052","3.0E-4","0.002","0.313","0.0111","0.5938","0.0049","0.0351","3.0E-4","0.0029","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1457","0.0693","0.1431","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0098","0.0031","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0025","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.5654","4.0E-4","0.0024","0.0041","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0071","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0072","0.0267","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0017","0.0012","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0014","5.0E-4"

"20","Nature of urban interventions in changing the old center of a globalizing Doha","Doha, Qatar is continuously positioning itself at the forefront of international urbanism with different qualities of expression in terms of economy, culture, and global outlook, and is characterized by fast-tracked urban development process with large-scale urban interventions in the old center. Although the unprecedented urban growth of this city continues to be a subject of discussion, little attention has been given to investigate the new interventions and the resulting effects they have on the old center. This study aims to examine three important urban interventions, namely, the Museum of Islamic Art, the reconstruction of the traditional market called Souq Waqif, and the Msheireb urban regeneration project. It examines local and global issues, universal standard practices, and traditional knowledge. This study employs a descriptive analysis of these interventions to explore the impact of change in the old center, exemplified by socio-spatial and typo-morphological aspects. Reference is made to a number of empirical studies, including behavioral mapping, GIS population statistics, and analysis of historical maps. Results analytically narrate the reactions of these interventions to the possibility of simultaneously adopting universal practices with local knowledge, and whether prioritizing local influences would represent narrow-mindedness in shaping the city.","A","836","A & B & C & D","19/04/15","123","true","","9.0E-4","0.1712","0.001","0.0057","0.0054","0.0068","0.0635","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.4716","0.2542","6.0E-4","0.0019","0.0144","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0019","0.0086","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0545","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0013","0.0502","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0291","0.0011","0.001","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2468","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0757","0.3213","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0479","1.0E-4","0.0024","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0703","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0762"
"21","Longitudinal trajectories of peer relations in children with specific language impairment","Background Peer relations is a vulnerable area of functioning in children with specific language impairment (SLI), but little is known about the developmental trajectories of individuals. Methods Peer problems were investigated over a 9-year period (from 7 to 16 years of age) in 171 children with a history of SLI. Discrete factor growth modelling was used to chart developmental trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors associated with group membership. Results Four distinct developmental trajectories were identified: low-level/no problems in peer relations (22.2% of participants), childhood-limited problems (12.3%), childhood-onset persistent problems (39.2%) and adolescent-onset problems (26.3%). Risk of poor trajectories of peer relations was greater for those children with pragmatic language difficulties. Prosocial behaviour was the factor most strongly associated with trajectory group membership. Overall, the more prosocial children with better pragmatic language skills and lower levels of emotional problems had less difficulty in developing peer relations. Conclusions Analysis of developmental trajectories enriches our understanding of social development. A sizeable minority in the present sample sustained positive relations through childhood and adolescence, and others overcame early difficulties to achieve low levels of problems by their early teens; the majority, however, showed childhood-onset persistent or adolescent-onset problems.","B","837","E & F & G","06/12/15","136","true","","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.2426","0.0067","0.0051","0.2189","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0052","0.0079","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.078","0.2866","3.0E-4","0.1063","0.0381","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.015","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0151","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1629","0.1352","0.083","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2179","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0051","1.0E-4","0.003","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0933","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2409","2.0E-4","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0193","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"22","How radical is student engagement? (And what is it for?)","This paper argues that the term ‘student engagement’ as used in UK higher
education covers activities with two distinct sets of benefits: those that are
pedagogical, and those that are political. Without an overarching account of the
value of student engagement that can unify these two sets of benefits, the concept of student engagement in the UK is therefore fundamentally fractured. The paper proposes that critical pedagogy can provide that underpinning account, but at the expense of the current mainstream nature of student engagement. The paper therefore argues that those working in student engagement in UK higher education face a dilemma: either sacrifice the idea of student engagement as a popular solution to mainstream challenges, or give up the idea that student engagement has a unified set of benefits and coherent purpose.","C","266","H","27/12/19","71","true","","0.0021","5.0E-4","0.0027","0.0064","0.0019","0.3693","9.0E-4","0.0088","0.0026","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0018","0.5081","0.0902","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0014","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0026","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0028","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0019","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1361","0.001","0.0076","0.4027","2.0E-4","0.0358","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0044","0.0038","0.3769","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0074","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0047","3.0E-4","0.0013"

All three Na complexes have distorted square pyramidal NaO5 coordination geometries but different conformations of the four basal ligands and different hydrogen bonding interactions for the apical ligand. The hydrogen bonded synthons that have been identified for other species that contain neutral CBZ molecules are absent in all these Na containing ICC phases and are replaced by Na−O dative bonds. However, previously identified nonpolar supramolecular constructs in the form of stacks and dimers are shared with other CBZ containing structures.","D","209","I & J","27/02/17","78","true","","0.0248","0.0031","0.0013","0.0014","8.0E-4","0.0065","0.0495","0.4418","0.0032","0.0015","0.1182","0.0042","0.0043","0.1912","0.0772","0.0456","0.02","0.0012","0.0017","0.0035","3.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0025","2.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0017","0.0318","0.0039","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0017","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0026","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.1777","0.0043","0.1636","0.0015","0.3595","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0011","0.017","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0152","0.0209","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0016","2.0E-4","0.172","9.0E-4","0.0017","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0015","0.0014","0.002","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"24","New families of Sun-centred non-Keplerian orbits over cylinders and spheres","This paper introduces new families of Sun-centered non-Keplerian orbits (NKOs) that are constrained to a three-dimensional, cylindrical or spherical surface. As such, they are an extension to the well-known families of displaced NKOs that are confined to a two-dimensional plane. The cylindrical and spherical orbits are found by investigating the geometrically constrained spacecraft dynamics. By imposing further constraints on the orbit's angular velocity and propulsive acceleration, the set of feasible orbits is defined. Additionally, the phase spaces of the orbits are explored and a numerical analysis is developed to find periodic orbits. The richness of the problem is further enhanced by considering both an inverse square acceleration law (mimicking solar electric propulsion) and a solar sail acceleration law to maintain the spacecraft on the three-dimensional surface. The wealth of orbits that these new families of NKOs generate allows for a range of novel space applications.","E","179","K & L & M","13/06/17","85","true","","0.0103","0.0019","4.0E-4","0.0011","0.0019","0.0025","0.002","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.6146","0.0013","0.0181","0.0025","0.332","4.0E-4","0.0022","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0072","3.0E-4","0.0141","0.0016","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1001","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0025","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0017","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2787","0.0032","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0039","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0059","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0025","0.0011","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.5726","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"25","What's in a bug report?","Context: Bug reports are the primary means by which users of a system are able to communicate a problem to the developers, and their contents are important - not only to support developers in maintaining the system, but also as the basis of automated tools to assist in the challenging tasks of finding and fixing bugs. Goal: This paper aims to investigate how users report bugs in systems: what information is provided, how frequently, and the consequences of this. Method: The study examined the quality and quantity of information provided in 1600 bugs reports drawn from four open-source projects (Eclipse, Firefox, Apache HTTP, and Facebook API), recorded what information users actually provide, how and when users provide the information, and how this affects the outcome of the bug. Results: Of the recorded sources of information, only observed behaviour and expected results appeared in more than 50% of reports. Those sources deemed highly useful by developers and tools such as stack traces and test cases appeared very infrequently. However, no strong relationship was observed between the provided information and the outcome of the bug. Conclusions: The paper demonstrates a clear mismatch between the information that developers would wish to appear in a bug report, and the information that actually appears. Furthermore, the quality of bug reports has an important impact on research which might rely on extracting this information automatically.","B","575","M & A","23/01/17","114","true","","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0028","4.0E-4","0.001","0.3172","0.0047","0.0027","0.0202","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.1472","0.4734","0.0051","0.0038","0.0053","0.0035","0.0105","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0022","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0094","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0044","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.003","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1694","0.0364","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.4205","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0033","2.0E-4","0.0804","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0121","3.0E-4","0.1848","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.006","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0111","0.0015","4.0E-4","0.0395","2.0E-4","0.0044","2.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4"

The data set is a sample from the Chinese consumer electronics industry. Following mainly the problem solving perspective (PSP) within the knowledge based view (KBV), we develop and test several PSP and KBV hypotheses, in conjunction with competing transaction cost economics (TCE) alternatives, in an examination of the determinants of the R&D organization mode. The results show that a firm’s existing knowledge base is the single most important explanatory variable. Problem complexity and decomposability are also found to be important, consistent with the theoretical predictions of the PSP, but it is suggested that these two dimensions need to be treated as separate variables. TCE hypotheses also receive some support, but the estimation results seem more supportive of the PSP and the KBV than the TCE.","D","986","B & C","21/12/17","83","true","","0.0025","0.0043","0.0044","0.0032","0.0017","0.0051","0.0049","6.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.0133","0.1204","0.4323","0.3695","5.0E-4","0.0317","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0026","0.0012","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0015","0.0063","1.0E-4","0.0017","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0448","0.0024","6.0E-4","0.0624","0.0055","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0677","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3223","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0026","2.0E-4","0.0043","0.0053","0.0031","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2898","0.0071","0.0042","0.0017","0.0012","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0165","2.0E-4","0.0013","3.0E-4","0.1379"

"28","Planning natural repointing manoeuvres for nano-spacecraft","In this paper the natural dynamics of a rigid body are exploited to plan attitude manoeuvres for a small spacecraft. By utilising the analytical solutions of the angular velocities and making use of Lax pair integration, the time evolution of the attitude of the spacecraft in a convenient quaternion form is derived. This enables repointing manoeuvres to be generated by optimising the free parameters of the analytical expressions, the initial angular velocities of the spacecraft, to match prescribed boundary conditions on the final attitude of the spacecraft. This produces reference motions which can be tracked using a simple proportional-derivative controller. The natural motions are compared in simulation to a conventional quaternion feedback controller and found to require lower accumulated torque. A simple obstacle avoidance algorithm, exploiting the analytic form of natural motions, is also described and implemented in simulation. The computational efficiency of the motion planning method is discussed.","E","418","E & F","19/05/16","93","true","","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0019","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.3844","0.0017","0.1117","0.0067","0.4274","7.0E-4","0.0012","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.059","3.0E-4","0.0106","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0048","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1022","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1041","7.0E-4","0.0075","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4779","0.0019","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0157","0.0011","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0382","1.0E-4","0.0015","0.0016","5.0E-4","0.0022","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2225","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"29","Dynamical systems techniques for designing libration point orbits in proximity of highly-inhomogeneous planetary satellites: Application to the Mars-Phobos elliptic three-body problem with additional gravity harmonics","The orbital dynamics around the Libration points of the classical circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) have been investigated in detail: in the last few decades, dynamical systems theory has provided invaluable analytical and numerical tools for understanding the dynamics of Libration Point Orbits (LPOs).  The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon's surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system.  Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing/take-off pathways to and from Phobos' surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.","C","978","H & J","08/12/17","162","true","","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.5528","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0013","0.4412","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0433","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0056","1.0E-4","0.377","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0041","6.0E-4","0.0252","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.5377","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"

We show that the entanglement between excitations of two Bose-Einstein condensates is degraded after one of them undergoes a change in the gravitational field strength. This prediction can be tested if the condensates are initially entangled in two separate satellites while being in the same orbit and then one of them moves to a different orbit. We show that the effect is observable in a typical orbital manoeuvre of nanosatellites like CanX4 and CanX5.","D","701","D","15/08/15","51","true","","0.0108","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0029","5.0E-4","0.0018","0.0082","9.0E-4","0.2681","0.2972","7.0E-4","0.0012","0.0044","0.3978","4.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0011","9.0E-4","0.1357","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0043","0.001","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0021","2.0E-4","0.1819","2.0E-4","0.3553","0.0018","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0011","4.0E-4","0.144","3.0E-4","0.0045","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.1539","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"133","An application of Six Sigma methodology for improving the first pass yield of a grinding process","The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the power of the Six Sigma methodology in improving the first pass yield of a high-precision grinding process in the manufacture of automotive products.
The paper follows a case study approach showing how theory has been put into practice. The case study was executed in a leading automotive company based in India.
The application of the Six Sigma methodology resulted in a reduction of tolerance-related problems and improved the first pass yield from 85 to over 99 per cent. A number of tools and techniques in the Six Sigma tool box have been utilised for data analysis and drawing valid and sound conclusions. The implementation of the Six Sigma methodology has demonstrated a saving of US$70,000 in addition to the customer-facing benefits of improved quality on returns and sales.
The results of the case study have provided greater stimulus within the production facilities for wider application of the methodology as a powerful problem solving methodology. Moreover, this case study sets the foundation for many other projects within the business.
The paper is valuable to many Six Sigma black belts, practitioners of Six Sigma and researchers in terms of understanding the systematic application of the methodology in a real world situation.","A","106","C","25/05/17","116","true","","6.0E-4","0.0027","4.0E-4","0.0376","0.0037","0.0347","0.0052","8.0E-4","0.0026","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0016","0.3036","0.5075","0.0012","0.0129","0.0043","0.0759","0.0026","0.002","3.0E-4","0.003","0.0012","0.0221","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.001","0.0024","1.0E-4","0.0013","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0033","0.0051","1.0E-4","0.0054","5.0E-4","0.0014","7.0E-4","0.0041","1.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","0.3737","0.0191","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0038","0.3067","2.0E-4","0.0372","0.001","0.0209","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1501","1.0E-4","0.0017","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0269"
"134","The role of EU pre-accession assistance in the establishment of national coordination structures for EU funding: the case of Croatia","Coordination at the national level is an essential part of the EU policy process. This article analyses the effects of EU pre-accession programmes on the development of national-level structures for the coordination of EU funds in Croatia. The article is based on an in-depth case study of the Croatian coordination structures for EU funding, using a three-step analytical framework of adaptation. The empirical research focuses on the role and influence of the Croatian Central State Office for Development Strategy and Coordination of EU Funds (CODEF). The main finding was that preaccession assistance played a decisive role in the establishment and early support of national coordination structures. However, holistic reform in the state sector was not achieved and the new institutions were often challenged by domestic opposition structures. The research provides useful insights for the literature on Europeanization in accession countries, and for EU pre-accession policy.","E","318","B & E","20/12/16","99","true","","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0036","0.0019","0.0839","0.1275","0.001","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.4694","0.304","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0029","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0025","0.1098","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0018","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0057","0.0153","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1003","0.1558","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0019","8.0E-4","0.0526","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.5408","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0013","0.0023","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"135","Just telling and selling: current limitations in the use of digital media in public health: A scoping review","Objective - To undertake a scoping review and to map research in the area of digital media use in public health.

Study design - Scoping review.

Methods - PubMed, PsycINFO, Google and major textbooks of public health communication and health psychology were searched for primary studies or systematic reviews examining the use of digital media in a health context. Searches focussed on studies published between the start of 2000 and the end of June 2013. Abstracts of reviews of public health interventions were examined with respect to target groups, health topic, intervention characteristics, media used, study design, issues of quality and ethics, and outcomes. To map this area of work fully, this information was supplemented by adding information from primary studies. Areas were identified where systematic review evidence was scarce or non-existent by comparing the final map with information from the reviews analysed.

Results - 221 systematic reviews related to digital media use in a public health context were included. Most reviews included studies with an experimental design and general ‘at risk’ target populations. Specific settings were not specified in the majority of reviews. A large variety of health topics were covered. About a quarter of reviews did not specify a health topic but were concerned with broader issues of health promotion, disease prevention, or health education. Over half of the reviews focussed on eHealth and telemedicine, and another third were concerned with mass media – social marketing. Reviews most frequently reported behaviour-related outcomes or conducted some form of content analysis or analysis of the use of particular media. Research gaps were identified relating to community-based research, participation and empowerment, active media use (especially with respect to visual media und use of specific visual methodologies), and the use of salutogenic or assets-based approaches.

Conclusion - The available research relating to digital media use in public health is dominated by studies relating to eHealth, telehealth or social marketing; emphasising the passive reception of messages and a focus on individual behaviour change approaches. Issues of quality and ethics need to be taken into account more consistently. Further research is needed with respect to more participatory methods, particularly those which would seek to use digital media as a means to harness individual and community assets.","A","244","E & F","25/03/16","220","true","","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0032","0.0015","6.0E-4","0.5289","0.0013","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0015","0.1889","0.2039","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0616","3.0E-4","0.0055","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0021","1.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0137","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0017","0.0092","4.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1864","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0364","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.5326","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0053","1.0E-4","0.0276","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1303","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0449"

The approach to evidence-informed practice is characterised as four pillars of activity. The first focuses on improving awareness and access to evidence. The second refers to strengthening the evidence base and is discussed in the context of work on self-directed support. Improving skills and confidence to use evidence forms the third pillar. The final pillar is embedding evidence in organisations, through coproduction, creating spaces to test and challenge evidence, and through the development of evidence-based products.","B","139","F & K","30/12/17","70","true","","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.24","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0013","6.0E-4","0.5818","0.1687","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.003","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0022","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1633","0.0014","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0162","0.1595","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.002","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0023","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.5867","3.0E-4","0.0298","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0143","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0047"
"137","Modeling team knowledge sharing and team flexibility: the role of within-team competition","This study examines the role of within-team competition (i.e. team hypercompetition and team development competition) in a team process. We developed and tested a model that associates team collectivism as the antecedent of within-team competition, and knowledge sharing and team flexibility as the outcomes. The model was empirically tested with data from 141 knowledge-intensive teams. The empirical findings showed that team collectivism had a positive relationship with team development competition and a negative relationship with team hypercompetition. Regarding the outcomes, team development competition and team hypercompetition had an indirect relationship with knowledge sharing and team flexibility through team empowerment. We offer a number of original contributions to the team effectiveness literature, especially by showing that team hypercompetition and team development competition have different impacts on team knowledge sharing and team flexibility.","B","456","M & I","04/09/17","90","true","","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0051","0.4125","0.0017","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.4034","0.1559","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0159","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0166","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0311","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.286","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1149","0.1802","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0029","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2018","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0014","2.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.025","2.0E-4","0.0033","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1258"

"139","The economics of distributed energy generation: a literature review","The UK electricity system is likely to face dramatic technical and institutional changes in the near future.  Current UK energy policy focuses on the need for a clean, affordable and secure energy supply. Decentralisation of the electricity system is recognised as one means of achieving efficient and renewable energy provision, as well as addressing concerns over ageing electricity infrastructure and capacity constraints.    In this paper we provide a critical literature review of the economics of increased penetration of distributed energy generation.  We find that there exists a large volume of research considering the financial viability of individual distributed generation technologies (and we are necessarily selective in our review of these studies, given the wide variety of technologies that the definition of distributed generation encompasses).  However, there are few studies that focus on the pure economics of individual or groups of distributed energy generators, and even fewer still based on the economy-wide aspects of distributed generation.  In view of this gap in the literature, we provide suggestions for future research which are likely to be necessary in order adequately to inform public policy on distributed generation and its role in the future of UK energy supply.","C","827","E & A","20/07/19","111","true","","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0012","0.0069","0.0015","0.0015","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.001","0.4045","0.1556","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.4218","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4329","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0682","7.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0012","0.44","2.0E-4","0.004","0.0025","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0351"

To record changes in the force generating capacity of lower limb muscles (recorded as peak voluntary isometric torque at the knee and hip), before, during and after RAGT in both acute and subacute/chronic ISCI subjects using a repeated measures study design. Eighteen subjects with ISCI participated in this study (Age range: 26–63 years mean age = 49.3 ± 11 years). Each subject participated in the study for a total period of eight weeks, including 6 weeks of RAGT using the Lokomat system (Hocoma AG, Switzerland). Peak torques were recorded in hip flexors, extensors, knee flexors and extensors using torque sensors that are incorporated within the Lokomat. All the tested lower limb muscle groups showed statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases in peak torques in the acute subjects. Comparison between the change in peak torque generated by a muscle and its motor score over time showed a non-linear relationship. The peak torque recorded during isometric contractions provided an objective outcome measure to record changes in muscle strength following RAGT.","A","711","E","09/04/15","134","true","","5.0E-4","0.103","0.3846","0.0284","0.0014","0.0071","0.0011","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0578","0.0028","6.0E-4","0.0014","0.2276","0.0044","6.0E-4","0.1299","0.0025","9.0E-4","0.0452","0.0043","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.271","6.0E-4","0.0041","2.0E-4","0.008","0.0039","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0601","0.0281","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0517","0.2318","0.0294","3.0E-4","0.0102","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0042","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.001","0.001","0.001","1.0E-4","0.2382","0.0424","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0022"
"34","Polyhedral Study of Mixed Integer Sets Arising from Inventory Problems","""Branch-and-cut"" algorithm is one of the most efficient exact approaches to solve mixed integer programs. This algorithm combines the advantages of a pure branch-and-bound approach and cutting planes scheme. Branch-and-cut algorithm computes the linear programming relaxation of the problem at each node of the search tree which is improved by the use of cuts, i.e. by the inclusion of valid inequalities. It should be taken into account that selection of strongest cuts is crucial for their effective use in branch-and-cut algorithm.

In this thesis, we focus on the derivation and use of cutting planes to solve general mixed integer problems, and in particular inventory problems combined with other problems such as distribution, supplier selection, vehicle routing, etc. In order to achieve this goal, we first consider substructures (relaxations) of such problems which are obtained by the coherent loss of information. The polyhedral structure of those simpler mixed integer sets is studied to derive strong valid inequalities. Finally those strong inequalities are included in the cutting plane algorithms to solve the general mixed integer problems.

We study three mixed integer sets in this dissertation. The first two mixed integer sets arise as a subproblem of the lot-sizing with supplier selection, the network design and the vendor-managed inventory routing problems. These sets are variants of the  well-known single node fixed-charge network set where a binary or integer variable is associated with the node. The third set occurs as a subproblem of mixed integer sets where incompatibility between binary variables is considered. We generate families of valid inequalities for those sets, identify classes of facet-defining inequalities, and discuss the separation problems associated with the inequalities. Then cutting plane frameworks are implemented to solve some mixed integer programs. Preliminary computational experiments are presented in this direction.","B","376","A","17/05/17","176","true","","0.0376","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0305","0.0306","0.001","0.0198","0.0094","3.0E-4","0.0016","0.0175","0.3748","3.0E-4","0.3888","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0859","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0023","0.0204","1.0E-4","0.0247","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0044","1.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0027","0.2791","1.0E-4","0.0018","2.0E-4","0.3301","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0127","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0236","1.0E-4","0.0203","1.0E-4","0.024","1.0E-4","0.1304","0.0509","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0018","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0217","0.0418","2.0E-4"
"35","Influence of scaling effects on hub loads of a horizontal wind turbine","Wind industry aims to generate more energy and reduce energy cost by increasing energy capacity of machines. As a result the loading scales up non-linearly. Nowadays there is a lack of studies of variation loads (specially fatigue ones) due to the up-scaling of wind turbine. This paper aims to generate a general fatigue load trends of several wind turbines, which are available to public. The accuracy of a controller of wind turbine models was investigated by checking blade root bending moments. Subsequently, fatigue loads were calculated based on these bending moments of blade root for each wind turbine model. The obtained results demonstrated possibility to generate the general load trend among the models. Additionally the blade root loading was divided into deterministic and stochastic parts, where each part was investigated the effect on fatigue loads. Moreover, a sensitivity study was performed to identify how much of influence does wind turbulence was on fatigue loads by the increasing reference turbulence intensity.","A","906","G & H","19/11/18","103","true","","0.0134","0.2861","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.002","0.0027","0.0075","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0121","0.0115","0.4407","0.2094","0.0028","4.0E-4","0.001","0.0084","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","0.0063","2.0E-4","0.2221","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0031","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2978","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3929","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0253","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0376","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"36","Cepstral analysis of hypokinetic and ataxic voices: correlations with perceptual and other acoustic measures","To investigate the validity of cepstral analyses against other conventional acoustic measures of voice quality in determining the perceptual impression in different motor speech disorders—hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria, and speech tasks—prolonged vowels and connected speech.  Prolonged vowel productions and connected speech samples (reading passages and monologues) from 43 participants with Parkinson disease and 10 speakers with ataxia were analyzed perceptually by a trained listener using GRBAS. In addition, acoustic measures of cepstral peak prominence (CPP), smoothed CPP (CPPs), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), shimmer %, shimmer dB, amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), relative average perturbation (RAP), jitter, and pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ) were performed. Statistical analysis involved correlations between perceptual and acoustic measures, as well as determination of differences across speaker groups and elicitation tasks.  CPP and CPPs results showed greater levels of correlation with overall dysphonia, breathiness, and asthenia ratings than the other acoustic measures, except in the case of roughness. Sustained vowel production produced a higher number of significant correlations across all parameters other than connected speech, but task choice did not affect CPP and CPPs results. There were no significant differences in any parameters across the two speaker groups.  The results of this study are consistent with the results of other studies investigating the same measures in speakers with nonmotor-related voice pathologies. In addition, there was an indication that they performed better in relation to asthenia, which might be particularly relevant for the current speaker group. The results support the clinical and research use of CPP and CPPs as a quantitative measure of voice quality in populations with motor speech disorder.","A","145","I & C & M","25/07/17","168","true","","0.0045","0.038","0.3723","0.0088","6.0E-4","0.0211","6.0E-4","0.0011","0.0072","6.0E-4","0.0019","0.0018","0.0017","0.3472","4.0E-4","0.0011","0.0974","0.0785","0.0073","0.009","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0038","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0127","1.0E-4","0.0015","0.0015","0.0029","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.3168","0.0079","1.0E-4","0.3644","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","0.0081","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0052","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0222","0.0334","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1685","0.0069","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0329","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"37","Combination of genetics and spatial modelling highlights the sensitivity of cod (Gadus morhua) population diversity in the North Sea to distributions of fishing","Conserving genetic diversity in animal populations is important for sustaining their ability to respond to environmental change. However, the ‘between-population’ component of genetic diversity (biocomplexity) is threatened in many exploited populations, particularly marine fish, where harvest management regions may be larger than the spatial extent of genetically distinct sub-populations. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data we delineated the geographic limits of three population units of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in northwest European waters. Two of the populations co-habit the North Sea, and trawl survey data showed differing trends in their abundances. We developed a spatial model of these units to simulate population dynamics under spatial patterns of harvesting, Competition between units during the pelagic juvenile stages in the model led to suppression of the more localised northern North Sea (Viking) unit by the more widespread (Dogger) unit, and its premature extinction under some spatial patterns of fishing. Fishery catch limits for cod are set at the scale of the whole North Sea without regard to such sub-population dynamics. Our model offers a method to quantify adjustments to regional fishing mortality rates to strike a balance between maximising sustainable yield and conserving vulnerable populations.","B","294","L","06/11/19","133","true","","4.0E-4","0.208","0.0012","0.1997","8.0E-4","0.0038","7.0E-4","0.0116","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0775","6.0E-4","0.0633","0.3619","0.0011","0.0666","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0013","0.0011","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.046","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.003","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.433","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0589","0.0974","1.0E-4","0.2889","3.0E-4","0.0078","2.0E-4","0.0011","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.001","0.002","4.0E-4","0.0451","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0025","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0016","0.0021"
"38","Identifying prognostic indicators for electrical treeing in solid insulation through pulse sequence analysis","Predictive maintenance attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment and predict the future trend of the equipment's aging, in order to reduce costs when compared to the two traditional approaches: corrective and preventive maintenance. This prediction requires an accurate prognostic model of aging. In solid insulation, the ultimate goal of prognostics is to predict the advent of failure, i.e., insulation breakdown, in terms of remaining useful life (RUL). One fault is electrical treeing, which is progressive thus leading to potentially catastrophic failure. Research has shown that diagnosis of faults can be achieved based on partial discharge (PD) monitoring [1], i.e., phase-resolved and pulse sequence analysis (PSA). This work will explore the extension of this concept towards predicting evolution of the defect: moving beyond diagnostics towards prognostics. To do this, there is a need for further investigation of prognostic features within PD characteristics leading up to breakdown. In this work, a needle-plane test arrangement was set up using a hypodermic needle and pre-formed silicone rubber as test samples. The visual observations and tree growth measurements were made using a digital microscope. PD data was captured using a radio frequency (RF) sensor and analysed using PSA. The main idea of the PSA approach is the strong relationship between two consecutive pulses caused by PD activities, which can give an understanding of the local degradation processes [1]. As for electrical treeing, a breakdown indicator in PSA is the appearance of heavily clustered data points that lie diagonally in scatter plots of the differential ratio of voltage and time of consecutive charges (Un = Δun/Δtn) [2,3]. Figure 1 shows an example of a plot that changed to a diagonal line after 14 hours of aging time. This paper investigates the formation of the diagonal line based on the distribution of the plot from the start of electrical treeing until breakdown occurs. Finally, statistical features of the PSA plot are given and will be used for lifetime prediction of insulation samples in future work.","B","290","B & H","25/01/19","192","true","","0.0351","4.0E-4","0.0309","0.0059","0.0034","0.0048","0.0319","6.0E-4","0.0047","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0207","0.4577","5.0E-4","0.3011","0.0224","0.0033","0.076","2.0E-4","0.0013","0.0052","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0282","2.0E-4","0.0926","0.0131","0.0019","0.0014","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0266","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3898","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","5.0E-4","0.0094","0.0011","0.0733","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0055","0.0012","0.3041","1.0E-4","0.0064","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0132","1.0E-4","0.0013","0.0104","2.0E-4","7.0E-4"
"39","Methods and results of a search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts using the GEO 600, LIGO, and Virgo detectors","In this paper we report on a search for short-duration gravitational wave bursts in the frequency range 64 Hz-1792 Hz associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), using data from GEO 600 and one of the LIGO or Virgo detectors. We introduce the method of a linear search grid to analyze GRB events with large sky localization uncertainties, for example the localizations provided by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs) can be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not well localized, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival time between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky localization of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is observed in coincidence. We use the method of the linear grid in a search for GWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments between 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analyzed for GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analyzed using data from GEO 600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its sensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light interferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each GRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under an assumption of a fixed GW emission energy of 10(-2)M circle dot c(2), with a median exclusion distance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced computational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid searches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events once the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors begin operation.","C","819","D & L","09/02/18","186","true","","0.0871","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0596","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2674","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0053","0.4292","0.002","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0859","0.0587","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0186","1.0E-4","0.0633","0.0286","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0248","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3426","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.017","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0221","0.0099","1.0E-4","0.0098","0.0634","0.3789","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0039","0.0081","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"140","Th1 immune responses can be modulated by varying dimethyldioctadecylammonium and distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine content in liposomal adjuvants","OBJECTIVES: Cationic liposomes of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) combined with trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (TDB) elicit strong cell-mediated and antibody immune responses; DDA facilitates antigen adsorption and presentation while TDB potentiates the immune response. To further investigate the role of DDA, DDA was replaced with the neutral lipid of distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) over a series of concentrations and these systems investigated as adjuvants for the delivery of Ag85B-ESAT-6-Rv2660c, a multistage tuberculosis vaccine.METHODS: Liposomal were prepared at a 5 : 1 DDA-TDB weight ratio and DDA content incrementally replaced with DSPC. The physicochemical characteristics were assessed (vesicle size, zeta potential and antigen loading), and the ability of these systems to act as adjuvants was considered.KEY FINDINGS: As DDA was replaced with DSPC within the liposomal formulation, the cationic nature of the vesicles decreases as does electrostatically binding of the anionic H56 antigen (Hybrid56; Ag85B-ESAT6-Rv2660c); however, only when DDA was completed replaced with DSPC did vesicle size increase significantly. T-helper 1 (Th1)-type cell-mediated immune responses reduced. This reduction in responses was attributed to the replacement of DDA with DSPC rather than the reduction in DDA dose concentration within the formulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest Th1 responses can be controlled by tailoring the DDA/DSPC ratio within the liposomal adjuvant system.","A","405","A & G","22/04/19","148","true","","0.0171","0.0117","0.0014","0.0076","3.0E-4","0.0066","0.001","0.0101","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.4815","0.0119","0.02","0.4051","4.0E-4","0.0192","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0023","0.0027","4.0E-4","0.0825","2.0E-4","0.0013","0.0011","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0073","0.0303","4.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","0.0092","2.0E-4","0.0027","0.0491","7.0E-4","0.0023","0.0784","4.0E-4","0.0058","0.3192","0.0253","0.0056","0.0072","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0086","0.2523","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0703","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0241","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"141","Conformations and effective interactions of polymer coated nanoparticles at liquid interfaces","We investigate conformations and effective interactions of polymer-coated nanopar- ticles adsorbed at a model liquid-liquid interface via molecular dynamics simulations. The polymer shells strongly deform at the interface, with the shape governed by a balance between maximising the decrease in interfacial area between the two solvent components, minimising unfavourable contact between polymer and solvent and max- imising the conformational entropy of the polymers. Using potential of mean force calculations we compute the effective interaction between the nanoparticles at the liquid-liquid interface. We find that it differs quantitatively from the bulk and is sig- nificantly affected by the length of the polymer chains and by the solvent quality. Under good solvent conditions the effective interactions are always repulsive and soft for long chains. The repulsion range decreases as the solvent quality decreases. In particular, under poor solvent conditions, short chains may fail to induce steric repul- sion, leading to a net attraction between the nanoparticles, whereas with long enough chains the effective interaction potential may feature an additional repulsive shoulder at intermediate distances.","D","932","H & L","09/10/15","110","true","","0.0011","3.0E-4","0.0015","0.0017","5.0E-4","0.0011","0.1426","0.1989","0.0431","0.0019","0.1168","0.1035","0.0068","0.3625","0.0058","0.0089","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0018","6.0E-4","0.2544","0.0046","4.0E-4","0.0021","9.0E-4","0.0058","0.0031","2.0E-4","0.0081","2.0E-4","0.0109","0.0021","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0185","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0019","0.1559","1.0E-4","0.3173","0.0049","0.1195","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0246","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0058","0.0132","0.0058","0.0014","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.004","8.0E-4","0.0241","0.0015"
"142","Laser pulse propagation and enhanced energy coupling to fast electrons in dense plasma gradients","Laser energy absorption to fast electrons during the interaction of an ultra-intense (1020 W/cm2), picosecond laser pulse with a solid is investigated, experimentally and numerically, as a function of the plasma density scale length at the irradiated surface. It is shown that there is an optimum density gradient for efficient energy coupling to electrons and that this arises due to strong self-focusing and channeling driving energy absorption over an extended length in the preformed plasma. At longer density gradients the laser laments, resulting in significantly lower overall energy coupling. As the scale length is further increased, a transition to a second laser energy absorption process is observed experimentally via multiple diagnostics. The results demonstrate that it is possible to significantly enhance laser energy absorption and coupling to fast electrons by dynamically controlling the plasma density gradient.","B","599","D","27/08/19","91","true","","0.7304","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0908","0.0035","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0018","0.0022","0.1655","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.6709","0.0224","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0111","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.0041","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0035","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2436","0.0311","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0034","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"143","Parallel centerline extraction on the GPU","Centerline extraction is important in a variety of visualization applications including shape analysis, geometry processing, and virtual endoscopy. Centerlines allow accurate measurements of length along winding tubular structures, assist automatic virtual navigation, and provide a path-planning system to control the movement and orientation of a virtual camera.

However, efficiently computing centerlines with the desired accuracy has been a major challenge. Existing centerline methods are either not fast enough or not accurate enough for interactive application to complex 3D shapes. Some methods based on distance mapping are accurate, but these are sequential algorithms which have limited performance when running on the CPU. To our knowledge, there is no accurate parallel centerline algorithm that can take advantage of modern many-core parallel computing resources, such as GPUs, to perform automatic centerline extraction from large data volumes at interactive speed and with high accuracy.

In this paper, we present a new parallel centerline extraction algorithm suitable for implementation on a GPU to produce highly accurate, 26-connected, one-voxel-thick centerlines at interactive speed. The resulting centerlines are as accurate as those produced by a state-of-the-art sequential CPU method [40], while being computed hundreds of times faster. Applications to fly through path planning and virtual endoscopy are discussed. Experimental results demonstrating centeredness, robustness and efficiency are presented.","C","320","C","22/12/19","133","true","","0.001","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0011","0.0019","4.0E-4","0.0015","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0048","0.0142","0.5725","0.0023","0.1206","0.004","0.1345","0.1372","0.0014","0.0028","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0804","0.0298","1.0E-4","0.003","0.0012","2.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1246","2.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.501","0.0018","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0058","2.0E-4","0.0788","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1037","0.0024","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0432","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0017","0.0087","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"

To that end it will focus on real-time representation of converter devices on different platforms, enabling the future coupling of prototyping controllers to power system simulation tools. The small time-step, high fidelity representation of the converter devices and the large time-step model of the grid will be carried out on RTDS Technologies, RTDS and perhaps expanding the attempt, on OPAL-RT Technologies, OPAL-RT Simulator in the future. The controller prototyping, including the converter switching strategy will be implemented on ADI's rtXand the use of other rapid controller prototyping systems will also be evaluated. This will effectively allow the exploration of the scalability and limits of such schemes. Namely, how many converters can be simulated on real-time simulation devices? How many controllers can be implemented on a prototyping platform using modern microprocessors?","E","143","B & E","19/12/15","94","true","","0.0014","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0108","0.0054","0.0011","0.0021","3.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.0029","0.0077","0.5925","4.0E-4","0.001","8.0E-4","0.0052","0.3665","3.0E-4","0.0032","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0045","3.0E-4","0.0019","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0399","1.0E-4","0.0028","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4855","9.0E-4","0.0063","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0014","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0498","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2913","0.001","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0887","2.0E-4","0.0135","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4"

"146","Effect of incorporating cholesterol into DDA:TDB liposomal adjuvants on bilayer properties, biodistribution, and immune responses","Cholesterol is an abundant component of mammalian cell membranes and has been extensively studied as an artificial membrane stabilizer in a wide range of phospholipid liposome systems. In this study, the aim was to investigate the role of cholesterol in cationic liposomal adjuvant system based on dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) and trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (TDB) which has been shown as a strong adjuvant system for vaccines against a wide range of diseases. Packaging of cholesterol within DDA:TDB liposomes was investigated using differential scanning calorimetery and surface pressure-area isotherms of lipid monolayers; incorporation of cholesterol into liposomal membranes promoted the formation of a liquid-condensed monolayer and removed the main phase transition temperature of the system, resulting in an increased bilayer fluidity and reduced antigen retention in vitro. In vivo biodistribution studies found that this increase in membrane fluidity did not alter deposition of liposomes and antigen at the site of injection. In terms of immune responses, early (12 days after immunization) IgG responses were reduced by inclusion of cholesterol; thereafter there were no differences in antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2b) responses promoted by DDA:TDB liposomes with and without cholesterol. However, significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma were induced by DDA:TDB liposomes, and liposome uptake by macrophages in vitro was also shown to be higher for DDA:TDB liposomes compared to their cholesterol-containing counterparts, suggesting that small changes in bilayer mechanics can impact both cellular interactions and immune responses.","B","140","F & K","29/03/18","155","true","","0.002","0.0442","0.1703","0.0037","6.0E-4","0.0014","0.0157","0.1065","0.0034","8.0E-4","0.3415","0.0016","0.0026","0.2988","0.001","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0013","0.0031","0.0017","3.0E-4","0.0366","3.0E-4","0.0093","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.018","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0044","6.0E-4","0.0635","3.0E-4","0.0021","0.0206","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3125","0.066","0.0048","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0092","0.2331","0.0098","2.0E-4","0.0051","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1516","1.0E-4","0.0015","0.0414","0.0016","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0014","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"147","Development of a readability index attuned to the new English Course of Study in Japan","For several years, we have been engaged in evaluating techniques for estimating readability. Arising from this work, there have been several iterations of readability indices attuned to the English textbooks employed in Japanese high schools for the English Course of Study. In this paper, we briefly review approaches to readability measurement before detailing our project that aims to develop new readability indices that are attuned to the new English teaching system of Japan. Our earlier approach to the Japanese English teaching context employed regression analysis to develop a linear measure in which sentence length, word length, word difficulty and idiom difficulty are independent  variables and the textbook year of passages is a dependent variable. This linear function (Diff) proved to be broadly effective as a guide to reading level for English texts in the Japanese school context and was released for use as 'the Ozasa-Fukui Year Level'. From 2012, changes to the English Course of Study in Japan made it necessary to update this English readability index. To this end, our earlier approach was enhanced to provide a non-linear formula in which an experts’ readability judgement of English sentences is employed as a dependent variable and combined with the previously developed linear function (Diff) as an independent variable. The resultant computation yielded a non-linear function expression: NewDiff = a/(1+b*exp(-c*Diff))+0.9 in which we have the following component values:
a=3.8593, b=766.9372, c=2.5709, Diff = 0.0863*Words/S + 0.2943*Syllables/W + 0.6332*WordDiff/W + 0.0665*IdiomDiff/S + 0.5366. Applying this new measure, we determined that the coefficient of determination for this new formula (r^2) was 0.8236. Thereby, indicating a high degree of fit to the target data.","C","259","M & I","13/11/16","149","true","","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2176","0.0014","6.0E-4","0.0788","0.0013","3.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","0.0082","0.0045","0.0339","0.5318","5.0E-4","0.1166","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0274","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0334","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.0133","0.0018","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4686","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1826","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0153","0.0548","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0279","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0183","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1472","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"148","A protocol for storage limitations and upgrades in decentralised networks","Within the MaidSafe distributed network, users are able to store mutable and immutable data, which will remain accessible on the network in a distributed hash table, essentially forever. This raises an obvious question as to how to restrict malicious parties from making use of excessive network resources, in order to ensure the storage capacity of the network is not quickly depleted by a small number of users making excessive use of storage. Such activity risks preventing legitimate use of the network. This paper explores two possible means of secure storage quota management on such a decentralised network, and presents the concept of manager verification. It then presents a protocol-based solution to allow users to purchase extra storage from other users in a decentralised network, with irrepudiable and non-forgeable agreements, which are verifiable by any third party.","E","383","B & L","26/07/19","79","true","","7.0E-4","0.0027","5.0E-4","0.0017","0.1208","0.003","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0013","0.0012","5.0E-4","0.009","0.2339","0.1719","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0099","0.0081","0.4295","0.0032","0.0334","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.3809","0.001","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","0.0013","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0056","9.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1972","4.0E-4","0.001","8.0E-4","0.0047","0.0097","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0034","0.1592","5.0E-4","0.0257","0.0017","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1514","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","0.0019","8.0E-4"
"149","The ex vivo neurotoxic, myotoxic and cardiotoxic activity of cucurbituril-based macrocyclic drug delivery vehicles","The cucurbituril family of drug delivery vehicles have been examined for their tissue specific toxicity using ex vivo models. Cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]), cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and the linear cucurbituril-derivative Motor2 were examined for their neuro-, myo- and cardiotoxic activity and compared with β-cyclodextrin. The protective effect of drug encapsulation by CB[7] was also examined on the platinum-based anticancer drug cisplatin. The results show that none of the cucurbiturils have statistically measurable neurotoxicity as measured using mouse sciatic nerve compound action potential. Cucurbituril myotoxicity was measured by nerve-muscle force of contraction through chemical and electrical stimulation. Motor2 was found to display no myotoxicity, whereas both CB[6] and CB[7] showed myotoxic activity via a presynaptic effect. Finally, cardiotoxicity, which was measured by changes in the rate and force of right and left atria contraction, was observed for all three cucurbiturils. Free cisplatin displays neuro-, myo- and cardiotoxic activity, consistent with the side-effects seen in the clinic. Whilst CB[7] had no effect on the level of cisplatin's neurotoxic activity, drug encapsulation within the macrocycle had a marked reduction in both the drug's myo- and cardiotoxic activity. Overall the results are consistent with the relative lack of toxicity displayed by these macrocycles in whole animal acute systemic toxicity studies and indicate continued potential of cucurbiturils as drug delivery vehicles for the reduction of the side effects associated with platinum-based chemotherapy.","A","484","E & A","03/10/15","147","true","","9.0E-4","0.3014","0.0109","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0039","0.013","0.0077","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3362","0.0017","0.0063","0.2341","0.0019","7.0E-4","0.0562","0.002","0.0012","0.021","2.0E-4","0.0034","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0153","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0019","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","5.0E-4","0.1711","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0029","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0016","0.002","0.2816","6.0E-4","0.0128","4.0E-4","0.0181","9.0E-4","0.019","0.1812","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0035","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0022","2.0E-4","0.0107","0.0262","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0012","0.0028","0.1486","0.0838","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"

"42","3D PiC code investigations of auroral kilometric radiation mechanisms","Efficient (∼1%) electron cyclotron radio emissions are known to originate in the X mode from regions of locally depleted plasma in the Earths polar magnetosphere. These emissions are commonly referred to as the Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). AKR occurs naturally in these polar regions where electrons are accelerated by electric fields into the increasing planetary magnetic dipole. Here conservation of the magnetic moment converts axial to rotational momentum forming a horseshoe distribution in velocity phase space. This distribution is unstable to cyclotron emission with radiation emitted in the X-mode. Initial studies were conducted in the form of 2D PiC code simulations [1] and a scaled laboratory experiment that was constructed to reproduce the mechanism of AKR. As studies progressed, 3D PiC code simulations were conducted to enable complete investigation of the complex interaction dimensions. A maximum efficiency of 1.25% is predicted from these simulations in the same mode and frequency as measured in the experiment. This is also consistent with geophysical observations and the predictions of theory.","C","318","H","13/10/18","103","true","","0.5721","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0027","0.01","7.0E-4","0.0062","0.0875","0.0012","0.0234","0.0028","0.2888","4.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0011","4.0E-4","0.0023","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4272","0.0026","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0193","0.0039","2.0E-4","0.0879","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","0.0976","1.0E-4","0.2623","0.0011","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0691","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0033","0.0018","1.0E-4","0.008","0.0025","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4"

We show that arrays of connected ring traps can also be created by carefully designing the shape of the conducting loop. We report on characteristics of the trap and mechanisms that limit the range of parameters available for experimental implementation, including non-adiabatic losses and heat dissipation by induced currents.

"46","Validation and calibration of the activPAL™ for estimating METs and physical activity in 4-6 year olds","Examine the predictive validity of
the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation, develop an activPAL™
threshold value to define moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities,
and examine the classification accuracy of the developed moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold value in 4- to 6-year-old
children.

A sample of forty 4- to 6-year-old
children from the Illawarra region in New South Wales, Australia were included
in data analysis.

Participants completed a ∼
150-min room calorimeter protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary
behaviors, light-intensity physical activities and moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities. activPAL™ accelerometer counts
were collected over 15s epochs. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry
and direct observation were used as the criterion measure. Predicted metabolic
equivalents were calculated using the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents
equation (activPAL™ software version 5.8.0). Predictive validity was
evaluated using dependent-samples t-tests. Participants were randomly allocated
into two groups to develop and cross-validate an intensity threshold for
moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis was used to determine moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold. The classification accuracy
of the developed threshold was cross-validated using sensitivity, specificity,
and area under the receiver operating characteristic-curve.

The activPAL™ metabolic
equivalents equation significantly overestimated metabolic equivalents during
sedentary behaviors and significantly underestimated metabolic equivalents for
light-intensity physical activities, moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical
activities and total metabolic equivalents compared to measured metabolic
equivalents (all P<0.001). The developed threshold of ≥1418 counts per 15s
resulted in good classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity
physical activities.

The current activPAL™ metabolic
equivalents equation requires further development before it can be used to
accurately estimate metabolic equivalents in preschoolers. The developed
threshold exhibited acceptable classification accuracy for moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities; however studies cross-validating this
moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold in free-living
preschool-aged children are recommended.","D","708","B & C","05/02/16","217","true","","5.0E-4","0.0012","0.0897","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0017","0.0031","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0033","4.0E-4","0.0012","0.2863","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.6086","0.001","0.0016","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0013","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2121","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2552","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0578","9.0E-4","0.0102","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0041","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0024","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4456","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0044","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4"

"150","The infant's creative vitality, in projects of self-discovery and shared meaning: how they anticipate school, and make it fruitful","This paper presents the child as a creature born with the spirit of an inquisitive and creative human being, seeking understanding of what to do with body and mind in a world of invented possibilities. He or she is intuitively sociable, seeking affectionate relations with companions who are willing to share the pleasure and adventure of doing and knowing with 'human sense'. Recent research traces signs of the child's impulses and feelings from before birth, and follows their efforts to master experience through stages of self-creating in enjoyable and hopeful companionship. Sensitive timing of rhythms in action and playful invention show age-related advances of creative vitality as the body and brain grow. Much of shared meaning is understood and played with before a child can benefit from school instruction in a prescribed curriculum of the proper ways to use elaborate symbolic conventions. We begin with the theory of James Mark Baldwin, who observed that infants and young children are instinctive experimenters, repeating experience by imitating their own as well as other's actions, accommodating to the resources of the shared world and assimilating new experiences as learned ideas for action. We develop a theory of the child's contribution to cultural learning that may be used to guide practice in early education and care of children in their families and communities and in artificially planned and technically structured modern worlds of bewildering diversity.","B","997","A & G","29/06/17","130","true","","7.0E-4","0.0086","0.1154","0.0036","0.0068","0.4401","0.0037","0.0011","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0122","5.0E-4","0.3437","0.0437","0.0016","0.0097","0.0019","0.001","0.0051","6.0E-4","0.0012","0.0011","0.0014","0.0168","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0019","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0013","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2443","0.0015","0.0132","0.0012","1.0E-4","0.0218","0.0069","4.0E-4","0.1565","1.0E-4","0.0026","7.0E-4","0.0053","0.0012","0.0699","0.365","2.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0687","3.0E-4","0.003","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0052","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"151","Islamic heritage marketing: the Umrah experience","A potential visitor’s image of a destination and its attributes is likely to influence their behaviour before, during, and after their trip. However, there is a lack of research into Islamic destination image (Jafari & Scott, 2013; Stephenson, 2014). Existing studies have commented on the differentiation between the expectation formation of Muslim and non-Muslim tourists; however these are often restricted to more secular destinations such as Turkey. Moreover, much of the literature which focuses solely on the Muslim community fails to explore beyond the realms of religious satisfaction of their experiences. This paper explores the journey of experience of Muslim pilgrims during the Islamic pilgrimage to the Umrah. Globally, the Hajj is one of the greatest traveller movements, demonstrating a significant rationale for the study of Islam within the heritage tourism domain. Islamic texts, such as the Quran, endorse traveling with a view to attaining social, physical and spiritual objectives. As such, tourism of various categories is compatible with Islam and inspired by its principles. However, the Hajj and Umrah is a highly commanded activity encompassing devout and monetary planning. Therefore, for some Muslims Hajj is a sacred obligation rather than form of heritage tourism. With this in mind, religious pilgrimage is likely to have a very strong destination image in the minds of Muslim visitors. Therefore, this paper looks not only at sacred obligation but also attitudes such as hedonic value, motivations, socialisation, gift, and evidence. Therefore, our study contributes to a wider understanding of the perceptions and behavioural outcomes of visitors toward Islamic destination image. To do so, we develop a conceptual model based i=on the theory of the ‘commodity fetishism’. The term ‘commodity fetishism’ refers to the system through which capitalist societies treat ‘commodities as if value inhered in the objects themselves, rather than in the amount of real labour expended to produce the object’. Thus, this paper attempts to address two gaps, firstly examining the symbolic importance to pilgrims of material objects of pilgrimage, and secondly examining this symbolic experience in the Islamic context of Umrah. Our survey data was collected in a number of tourists agents within Iran from Muslim pilgrims preceding their visit to the Umrah and returning home. Structural equation modelling is tested with a sample of 538 visitors. The empirical validation of the conceptual model supports a majority of the research hypotheses. These findings contribute to a better understanding of Islamic destination image in the heritage tourism context and a series of implications are proposed.","C","159","H & L","31/07/16","211","true","","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0024","0.0022","0.248","0.0618","0.0027","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.011","0.0045","0.0041","0.3747","0.1492","0.0709","0.001","0.0128","0.0521","0.0012","2.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","0.0457","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1014","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0013","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0027","7.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1671","0.0026","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.042","4.0E-4","0.0017","2.0E-4","0.1558","0.2949","0.0075","0.1279","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0011","7.0E-4","0.0055","1.0E-4","0.0071","0.0028","0.0031","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0184"
"152","Optimal design of water distribution systems based on entropy and topology","A new multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach for joint topology and pipe size design of water distribution systems is presented. The algorithm proposed considers simultaneously the adequacy of flow and pressure at the demand nodes; the initial construction cost; the network topology; and a measure of hydraulic capacity reliability. The optimization procedure is based on a general measure of hydraulic performance that combines statistical entropy, network connectivity and hydraulic feasibility. The topological properties of the solutions are accounted for and arbitrary assumptions regarding the quality of infeasible solutions are not applied. In other words, both feasible and infeasible solutions participate in the evolutionary processes; solutions survive and reproduce or perish strictly according to their Pareto-optimality. Removing artificial barriers in this way frees the algorithm to evolve optimal solutions quickly. Furthermore, any redundant binary codes that result from crossover or mutation are eliminated gradually in a seamless and generic way that avoids the arbitrary loss of potentially useful genetic material and preserves the quality of the information that is transmitted from one generation to the next. The approach proposed is entirely generic: we have not introduced any additional parameters that require calibration on a case-by-case basis. Detailed and extensive results for two test problems are included that suggest the approach is highly effective. In general, the frontier-optimal solutions achieved include topologies that are fully branched, partially- and fully-looped and, for networks with multiple sources, completely separate sub-networks.","D","958","D","03/10/15","148","true","","0.0025","0.0016","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0049","0.003","0.0013","0.0049","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0071","0.0023","0.4946","0.0703","0.2007","0.0032","0.0066","0.195","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0887","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0675","0.0085","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0013","1.0E-4","0.026","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0017","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1961","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.4322","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0018","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0017","3.0E-4","0.0558","2.0E-4","0.0051","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0723","0.0012","0.0011","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0034","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0022","0.023","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","9.0E-4"
"153","Isolation and identification of antitrypanosomal and antimycobacterial active steroids from the sponge haliclona simulans","The marine sponge Haliclona simulans collected from the Irish Sea yielded two new steroids: 24-vinyl-cholest-9-ene-3β,24-diol and 20-methyl-pregn-6-en-3β-ol,5a,8a-epidioxy, along with the widely distributed 24-methylenecholesterol. One of the steroids possesses an unusually short hydrocarbon side chain. The structures were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and confirmed using electron impact- and high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry. All three steroids possess antitrypanosomal and anti-mycobacterial activity. All the steroids were found to possess low cytotoxicity against Hs27 which was above their detected antitrypanosomal potent concentrations.","A","210","C","05/02/15","69","true","","0.1152","0.0027","9.0E-4","0.002","0.0011","0.0018","0.0053","0.036","5.0E-4","0.0015","0.1386","9.0E-4","0.0094","0.0689","0.5897","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0088","0.0164","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1039","4.0E-4","0.0039","2.0E-4","0.0521","8.0E-4","0.0023","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0044","0.0033","0.0105","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.003","6.0E-4","0.2365","0.0078","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0172","0.0058","7.0E-4","0.0021","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.005","0.0025","2.0E-4","0.0166","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4867","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0177","4.0E-4","0.0019","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0042","4.0E-4"
"154","A geostationary equivalent Polar observation system","Various potential polar observation systems are evaluated and compared against a set of requirements to develop a system capable of providing geostationary equivalent coverage of the Earth‟s high-latitude regions. Consideration is given to Non-Keplerian orbits, where it is found that the orbit altitudes are restrictively high, and traditional highly-elliptical Molniya orbits where it is found that no single spacecraft can provide observations „over the pole‟ to 55 degrees latitude of equal quality to those produced by geostationary systems. Subsequent analysis of the Taranis concept reveals the ability of these systems to adequately view the target region with a reduction in the required number of spacecraft. Mass budget analysis reveals a possible payload mass of 151 – 379 kg for a single platform launched using the Soyuz launcher to a 16 hour, 90 degree inclination Taranis orbit for an 8.5 year mission. Four spacecraft, capable of observing continuously to 55 degrees latitude using single imagery, can be launched on the Ariane 5, which results in a payload mass range of 193 – 482 kg for an 8.5 year mission.","E","155","B & E","12/09/15","102","true","","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","0.004","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.5133","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0061","0.4338","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0345","0.0022","3.0E-4","0.4948","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0335","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4511","0.0016","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.003","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0029","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012"
"155","Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism lighting projects with lamp population decay","This paper proposes a metering cost minimisation model that minimises metering cost under the constraints of sampling accuracy requirement for clean development mechanism (CDM) energy efficiency (EE) lighting project. Usually small scale (SSC) CDM EE lighting projects expect a crediting period of 10 years given that the lighting population will decay as time goes by. The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90% confidence and 10% precision, known as the 90/10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering cost minimisation model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II.J. The 90/10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost minimisation problem. Optimal solutions to the problem minimise the metering cost whilst satisfying the 90/10 criterion for each reporting period. The proposed metering cost minimisation model is applicable to other CDM lighting projects with different population decay characteristics as well.","A","226","E & F","10/11/18","139","true","","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0019","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0221","0.0014","7.0E-4","0.0234","0.0012","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.134","0.3779","0.1697","0.0041","5.0E-4","0.0544","0.1983","0.0075","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0906","0.1477","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0012","0.0584","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","0.0026","0.1159","1.0E-4","0.0025","0.001","0.3622","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0033","1.0E-4","0.001","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0125","5.0E-4","0.0302","0.0173","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0651","0.0033","1.0E-4","0.0022","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0257","0.0011","1.0E-4","0.0423","8.0E-4","0.0031","0.0013"
"156","DDSM-IDEA: a versatile dual-mode distributed demand side management integrated development environment","The ever-increasing demand for power has stimulated the development of a range of Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies that match end user consumption to the available mix of generation. The challenge of evaluating the performance of such schemes is massive since practical deployments are costly and hence flexible software evaluation/development environments become an attractive alternative. This paper details a versatile Distributed Demand Side Management Integrated Development Environment with multi-agent support (DDSM-IDEA), a platform to develop, execute, and evaluate the performance of various agentless and agent-based DSM and DDSM algorithms offering a spectrum of different resources, agents, and tools bundled into one package. The IDE platform includes a robust habitual demand profile generation module based on personal activity profiles, manual and automatic appliance control, and instantaneous demand disaggregation which in addition to its other capabilities and resources, makes it a more complete solution. The DDSM-IDEA is tested and several DSM and DDSM strategies are implemented and evaluated.","B","808","F & K","18/11/18","111","true","","5.0E-4","0.0015","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0055","6.0E-4","0.0023","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0054","0.0014","0.2397","0.2519","3.0E-4","0.0069","0.001","0.1671","0.3139","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0651","2.0E-4","0.2243","0.0018","0.0011","0.0994","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0013","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2934","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.215","1.0E-4","0.0017","0.0807","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4"

'All hell will break loose!'","Human rights education is a prominent concern of a number of international organisations and has been dominant on the United Nations’ agenda for the past 20 years. The UN Decade for Human Rights Education (1995–2004) has been followed by the World Programme for Human Rights Education (2005–ongoing) and the recently adopted UN Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training. This article shares findings from a project that aimed to gauge the knowledge of human rights education of students undertaking initial teacher education and childhood practice programmes at one university in Scotland. Students were invited to share their experiences of and attitudes towards human rights education. While some students were confident in their approach to human rights education, others identified barriers, including their own knowledge and the structures acting upon them as teachers. Initial conclusions suggest that education students feel ill-equipped to engage with human rights education and that this issue must be addressed in initial teacher education courses.","B","502","M & I","21/12/17","96","true","","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1263","0.6666","0.0021","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0034","5.0E-4","0.1626","0.0304","5.0E-4","0.001","0.0026","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0227","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0522","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3416","0.0015","0.2508","7.0E-4","0.0036","0.0017","0.0075","0.3069","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0013","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4"

Under ambient pressure only one polymorph of the title compound was isolated but when subjected to high pressure a further two polymorphs are observed. The phase transitions at >0.5 GPa and >3.6 GPa are reversible single crystal to single crystal transitions which is possible due to the similarity of the packing in the molecules. It is proposed that these transitions are driven by the pV term of the Gibbs Free Energy equation rather than by the relief of repulsive interactions between molecules.","C","420","E & A","26/11/19","56","true","","0.0192","0.0027","0.0052","0.111","7.0E-4","0.0028","0.0039","0.3255","0.015","4.0E-4","0.0046","0.2004","0.028","0.2447","0.0042","0.0027","6.0E-4","0.0012","0.014","0.0142","3.0E-4","0.0165","8.0E-4","0.0034","4.0E-4","0.0122","4.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","0.0855","0.0222","2.0E-4","0.121","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0012","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0395","5.0E-4","0.1556","0.0245","0.2263","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0022","0.0016","5.0E-4","0.0015","6.0E-4","0.021","0.1399","4.0E-4","0.0049","6.0E-4","0.0358","2.0E-4","0.0025","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0633","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0041","0.0025","5.0E-4","7.0E-4"

"52","Creative entrepreneurship and resistance: countercultural entrepreneurs' discourses, structures and practices of liberation?","Objectives: To explore if and how in the hands of the disenfranchised, social, cultural and (craft) human resources become creative tools of entrepreneurial resistance.

Prior work: The disenfranchised entrepreneur is contextualised in a range of marginal settings, including rural peripherality, depleted urban communities, socio-economic exclusion, counter-cultural social movements, post-colonialism, or belonging to an ethnic minority. In such settings, economic capital is typically largely absent or hard to come by, and dominant institutional structures remain firmly closed to would-be entrepreneurs. Studies are starting to show that - in contrast to dominant market-capitalism rhetorics of the heroic entrepreneur – that discourses, structures and practices of liberation are often developed by disenfranchised entrepreneurs, and especially through creative and craft entrepreneurship. 

Approach: This study explores three case studies of likely entrepreneurial resistance, all drawn from the same network of creative counter-cultural organizations in Athens: a tattoo parlour, a small chain of skate board shops, and a punk rock band. By selecting a sample drawn from the same community, analysis of the local context is enhanced. A mixture of qualitative research methods is used to gather rich longitudinal data, including semi-structured interviews, analysis of the internet and social media artefacts generated by these entrepreneurs, and participant observation. 

Results: Participants were centred towards their own worlds, beyond the mainstream (which they largely ignored), and were almost entirely engaged with the creative excellence, emotion and community this generated. 

Implications: Marginality, the position of powerlessness, can be deployed as a resource permitting a special kind of liberated entrepreneurship. Not only recognizing the barriers around established institutions (with their norms, and structures of dominance) such entrepreneurship of resistance actually turns being beyond the barriers into a space of freedom, a space of play.

Value: .

The grains are observed to have strong excitonic localization characteristics that are affected by their sizes. The tendency to confine excitons progressively intensifies with increasing grain boundary area. Photoluminescence results indicate that the MQW have a dominant effect on the peak energy of the near-bandedge emission at temperatures below 150 K, with the localization properties of the grains becoming evident beyond 150 K. Cathodoluminescence maps reveal that the grain boundary has no effect on the peak intensities of the AlGaN/AlGaN samples.","A","709","E","01/10/19","68","true","","0.0257","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.3681","0.0012","0.0018","0.5222","0.0223","0.0014","4.0E-4","0.0018","0.0023","0.0045","0.0307","0.006","0.0056","6.0E-4","0.0036","0.0012","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0038","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1955","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0235","0.0037","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0015","0.0021","0.0162","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0611","0.3959","0.0015","0.0015","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2076","5.0E-4","0.0012","5.0E-4","0.0067","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0011","0.0142","2.0E-4","0.0464","6.0E-4","0.0014","0.003","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4"
"54","An exploration of the effectiveness of artificial mini-magnetospheres as a potential solar storm shelter for long term human space missions","If mankind is to explore the solar system beyond the confines of our Earth and Moon the problem of radiation protection must be addressed. Galactic cosmic rays and highly variable energetic solar particles are an ever-present hazard in interplanetary space.
Electric and/or magnetic fields have been suggested as deflection shields in the past, but these treated space as an empty vacuum. In fact it is not empty. Space contains a plasma known as the solar wind; a constant flow of protons and electrons coming from the Sun.
In this paper we explore the effectiveness of a ""mini-magnetosphere"" acting as a radiation protection shield. We explicitly include the plasma physics necessary to account for the solar wind and its induced effects. We show that, by capturing/containing this plasma, we enhance the effectiveness of the shield. Further evidence to support our conclusions can be obtained from studying naturally occurring ""mini-magnetospheres"" on the Moon. These magnetic anomalies (related to ""lunar swirls"") exhibit many of the effects seen in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. If shown to be feasible, this technology could become the gateway to manned exploration of interplanetary space.","B","902","A","21/10/16","112","true","","0.2856","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0011","0.0127","0.0044","0.0019","0.0025","0.2815","0.0032","0.0161","0.1467","0.218","0.0165","0.0031","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0039","4.0E-4","0.0014","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1712","3.0E-4","0.0202","2.0E-4","0.0203","2.0E-4","0.0094","0.1066","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0015","0.094","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.215","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0119","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0028","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1005","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0073","0.0017","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2199","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4"

This paper focuses on a lighter than air system developed by Altaeros Energies. Using two force ratios the relationship between the  buoyancy and aerodynamic force is related to the geometric parameters of the shroud. A  dependence on a so-called area ratio is also shown relating the shrouds area to the shrouds  throat area used as a reference for aerodynamic calculations. This ratio was varied in  simulation and was found to have a marked effect on the driving forces over the shroud.  Finally, an investigation into whether helium or hydrogen should be used for this application is shown. It is found that the design of the shroud has to be aerodynamically optimized for successful operation and that the choice of which gas to employ becomes one of safety rather than enhanced performance.","A","172","I & C & M","22/11/17","82","true","","0.1379","0.0125","0.0014","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0022","0.0016","0.0167","5.0E-4","0.0021","8.0E-4","0.0417","0.1353","0.5443","0.0884","0.0073","4.0E-4","0.0017","0.0033","0.0017","0.0024","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0032","2.0E-4","0.0616","0.0019","0.1389","3.0E-4","0.0289","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0321","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0421","0.0063","7.0E-4","0.0081","3.0E-4","0.0031","1.0E-4","0.4488","0.0079","0.0098","9.0E-4","0.0022","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1803","0.0018","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0095","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4"

"58","Pension plan solvency and extreme market movements: a regime switching approach","We develop and test a new approach to assess defined benefit pension plan solvency risk in the presence of extreme market movements. Our method captures both the ‘fat-tailed’ nature of asset returns and their correlation with discount rate changes. We show that the standard assumption of constant discount rates leads to dramatic underestimation of future projections of pension plan solvency risk. Failing to incorporate leptokurtosis into asset returns also leads to downward biased estimates of risk, but this is less pronounced than the time-varying discount rate e§ect. Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns. These results have important implications for those with responsibility for balancing risk against expected return when seeking to improve the current poor funding positions of defined benefit pension schemes.","B","271","B & H","23/01/17","111","true","","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4","0.0475","0.0021","0.0054","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.2815","0.6076","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0448","6.0E-4","0.0048","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0034","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0024","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4819","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1735","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0527","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1487","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0051","0.1214"
"59","Wind Turbine Blade Leading Edge Erosion: An Investigation of Rain Droplet and Hailstone Impact Induced Damage Mechanisms","Leading edge erosion of modern wind turbine blades is a growing and developing issue within the wind industry, effecting blade performance and efficiency. Little is known, researched or published on the phenomenon and there are currently no apparent full-proof material solutions for the issue. The research presented here looks to develop a fuller understanding of the issue of leading edge erosion, through first reviewing the literature (both within and outwith wind energy) on the topic to put the issues in context, and then subsequently further exploring and investigating the key damage mechanisms associated rain droplet and hailstone impact on the blade leading edge; identified as two of the most erosive types of environmental exposure. Both numerical (finite element) and experimental methods are employed to identify the key damage mechanisms associated with each form of impact in the different possible blade material coating and substrate systems. It is found that for rain exposure, surface degradation and erosion is a real risk for classical gelcoat coating systems. Whereas, for newer flexible and more erosive resistant materials, interface damage and debonding from the substrate is the most likely form of damage creation. Hailstone impact is found to pose a heightened erosive threat in comparison to rain, based on individual impact damage creation; although it is recognised that hailstorms are far more infrequent than rain showers in most regions. However, it is predicted that for extreme hailstones of sufficient mass, significant substrate composite damage could also be created through impact on the leading edge. Future work and further research development aimed at further understanding the issues of blade leading edge erosion are also identified and discussed.","C","362","D & L","12/05/15","163","true","","4.0E-4","0.0848","5.0E-4","0.0366","7.0E-4","0.0013","0.0795","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1217","0.1928","0.3965","0.0709","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0108","0.002","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0021","2.0E-4","0.0028","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0722","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0544","0.0163","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0935","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3329","0.0422","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0038","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.269","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0474","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0521","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"160","Optimized Schwarz methods for curl-curl time-harmonic Maxwell's equations","Like the Helmholtz equation, the high frequency time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are difficult to solve by classical iterative methods. Domain decomposition methods are currently most promising: following the first provably convergent method in [4], various optimized Schwarz methods were developed over the last decade [1–3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]. There are however two basic formulations for Maxwell’s equation: the first order formulation, for which complete optimized results are known [5], and the second order, or curl-curl formulation, with partial optimization results [1, 13, 16]. We show in this paper that the convergence factors and the optimization process for the two formulations are the same. We then show by numerical experiments that the Fourier analysis predicts very well the behavior of the algorithms for a Yee scheme discretization, which corresponds to Nedelec edge elements on a tensor product mesh, in the curl-curl formulation. When using however mixed type Nedelec elements on an irregular tetrahedral mesh, numerical experiments indicate that transverse magnetic (TM) modes are less well resolved for high frequencies than transverse electric (TE) modes, and a heuristic can then be used to compensate for this in the optimization.","A","695","A & G","29/11/18","102","true","","0.0994","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0015","0.0012","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.5625","0.0029","0.231","3.0E-4","0.0868","0.0012","5.0E-4","0.0096","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0037","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0597","2.0E-4","0.4786","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0741","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2148","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.005","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1428","0.0103","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"

Since the first human intervention more than 10 years ago, over 50 different types of valves have been developed. The CoreValve and Edwards SAPIEN valves have both experienced clinical trials and the latter has gained FDA approval for implantation in patients considered inoperable. Current complications, such as major vascular bleeding and stroke, prevent these valves from being commonly deployed in patients considered operable in conventional surgery. This review focuses on the past and present achievements of these valves and highlights the design considerations required to progress development further.

"163","Ongoing initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China: statins as a case history","Pharmaceutical expenditure rose by 16% per annum in China during the past decade, and now represents 46% of total healthcare expenditure. Initiatives to moderate growth include pricing regulations for pharmaceuticals and encouraging International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing. However, there is limited monitoring of physician prescribing and current incentives encourage hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement.  The objective was to assess changes in statin utilization and expenditure as additional generics are launched. Subsequently, compare results in China with findings among European countries to provide future guidance.  We used observational retrospective study of statin utilization and procurement expenditure from 2004 to 2013 in two large teaching hospital groups.  The results were that statin utilization rose 32-fold in one hospital group and 54-fold in the other. Expenditure also increased but to a lesser extent, i.e. from just over Renminbi ‘yuan’ (CNY) 0.65 million in 2004 to CNY 15.3 million in 2013 in one hospital group and from CNY 0.49 to CNY 19.3 million in the other. Atorvastatin (originator) was the most utilized statin. Utilization of each generic statin was typically low, e.g. 10% in 2013 in one hospital group. Procurement prices fell over time, greatest for generic simvastatin (-74% to -91%) mirroring data from European countries. However, no increase in their prescribing was observed.

"164","A load sharing system reliability model with managed component degradation","Motivated by an industrial problem affecting a water utility, we develop a model for a load sharing system where an operator dispatches work load to components in a manner that manages their degradation. We assume degradation is the dominant failure type, and that the system will not be subject to sudden failure due to a shock. By deriving the time to degradation failure of the system, estimates of system probability of failure are generated, and optimal designs can be obtained to minimize the long run average cost of a future system. The model can be used to support asset maintenance and design decisions. Our model is developed under a common set of core assumptions. That is, the operator allocates work to balance the level of the degradation condition of all components to achieve system performance. A system is assumed to be replaced when the cumulative work load reaches some random threshold. We adopt cumulative work load as the measure of total usage because it represents the primary cause of component degradation. We model the cumulative work load of the system as a monotone increasing and stationary stochastic process. The cumulative work load to degradation failure of a component is assumed to be inverse Gaussian distributed. An example, informed by an industry problem, is presented to illustrate the application of the model under different operating scenarios.","E","794","B & E","26/07/17","130","true","","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0055","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0011","0.1447","4.0E-4","0.0046","0.048","0.5663","0.0039","0.0045","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2174","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1525","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1206","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0028","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0055","0.0031","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4807","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","0.001","4.0E-4","0.062","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0372","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1237","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"

"167","Energetic, environmental and economic modelling of a solar-assisted residential micro-trigeneration system in a Mediterranean climate","Reducing energy consumption in buildings has become a priority for most countries. However, designing energy-efficient buildings is not a straightforward task - the increasing demand for high comfort standards, provided by conventional 'energy-hungry' cooling and heating devices conflicts with the need for demand reduction. Trigeneration, the simultaneous production of electricity, cooling and heating is often viewed as a means of improving energy-efficiency in large and medium sized buildings whilst still delivering thermal comfort. For hot climates, the benefit of utilising the waste heat emitted from an engine unit to power a thermally driven cooling device provides scope to utilise an otherwise wasted energy stream. However, in smaller sized residential buildings, the relatively low and intermittent energy demand coupled with high capital costs, has stifled the uptake of the technology - although the potential for substantial energy savings exists. Moreover, it is very common for home owners in hot climates to opt for other energy-saving devices such as solar water heaters (SWH), which would tend to reduce further the possible demand for space and water heating, possibly making the simultaneous use of both micro-trigeneration and SWH unfeasible. This paper compares the performance of a residential micro-trigeneration system to a hybrid micro-trigeneration/SWH system. The performance of both systems was simulated using a whole building simulation tool run at a high time resolution. The results obtained were then used to quantify the energetic and environmental performance of both systems; and also to assess their financial viability against the effect of varying fuel prices, electricity tariffs and a varying Feed-in Tariff (FIT). Results show that whereas the solar aided micro-trigeneration system obtains an overall higher (though marginal) energetic and environmental performance, the financial performance for the same fiscal parameters (fuel prices and electricity tariffs) deteriorates. Moreover FIT, plays an important role in the financial feasibility of the system.","C","115","M & I","21/05/16","195","true","","0.0013","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1003","3.0E-4","0.0165","0.0675","4.0E-4","0.001","0.0024","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.1517","0.2872","0.0481","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0087","0.3113","0.0013","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002","0.2561","1.0E-4","0.0012","0.0039","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0554","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.042","2.0E-4","0.0056","0.0493","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0094","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3258","0.0853","0.0019","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.015","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1296","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0045","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0065"
"168","Accurate position tracking of optically trapped live cells","Optical trapping is a powerful tool in Life Science research and is becoming common place in many microscopy laboratories and facilities. There is a growing need to directly trap the cells of interest rather than introduce beads to the sample that can affect the fundamental biological functions of the sample and impact on the very properties the user wishes to observe and measure. However, instabilities while tracking large inhomogeneous objects, such as cells, can make tracking position, calibrating trap strength and making reliable measurements challenging. These instabilities often manifest themselves as cell roll or re-orientation and can occur as a result of viscous drag forces and thermal convection, as well as spontaneously due to Brownian forces. In this paper we discuss and mathematically model the cause of this roll and present several experimental approaches for tackling these issues, including using a novel beam profile consisting of three closely spaced traps and tracking a trapped object by analysing fluorescence images. The approaches presented here trap T cells which form part of the adaptive immune response system, but in principle can be applied to a wide range of samples where the size and inhomogeneous nature of the trapped object can hinder particle tracking experiments.","E","517","B & L","12/11/17","116","true","","0.0017","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0035","0.0011","0.01","0.1303","9.0E-4","0.0015","0.1478","0.1114","0.0818","0.0229","0.4806","5.0E-4","0.0016","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.003","2.0E-4","0.0581","0.2135","2.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.0304","0.0012","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0686","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0022","3.0E-4","0.0023","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0237","9.0E-4","0.4001","0.0797","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.008","0.013","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0829","0.0029","1.0E-4","0.0013","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"169","Using an epidemiological model to investigate unwarranted variation: the case of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion in England","Objectives: To investigate unwarranted variation in ventilation tube insertions for otitis media with effusion in children in England. This procedure is known to be 'overused' from clinical audits, as only one in three ventilation tube insertions conforms to the appropriateness criteria of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); but audits cannot identify the scale of 'underuse' - i.e. patients who would benefit but are not treated.
Methods:
To explore both 'underuse' and 'overuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion, we developed an epidemiological model based on: definitions of children with otitis media with effusion expected to benefit from ventilation tubes according to NICE guidance; epidemiological and clinical information from a systematic review; and expert judgement. A range of estimates was derived using Monte Carlo simulation and compared with the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service in 2010.
Results:
About 32,200 children in England would be expected to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion per year (between 20,411 and 45,231 with 90% certainty). The observed number of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion-associated diagnoses was 16,824.
Conclusions:
The expected population capacity to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion based on NICE guidance appeared to exceed, by far, the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service. So, while there is known 'overuse', there also may be substantial 'underuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion if NICE criteria were applied. Future investigations of unwarranted variation should, therefore, not only focus on the patients who are treated but also consider the potential for benefit at the population level.","A","335","E & A","03/02/15","159","true","","4.0E-4","0.0146","0.0052","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3013","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0022","0.0036","0.2642","0.0022","0.0883","0.0035","0.087","0.0077","0.2172","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","0.163","0.0712","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.074","0.0026","0.0199","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2518","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0447","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1218","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.106","1.0E-4","0.1269","0.0053","0.0017","0.0017","0.001","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4"

"61","Economic analysis of condition monitoring systems for offshore wind turbine sub-systems","The use of condition monitoring systems on wind turbines has increased dramatically in recent times. However, their use is mostly restricted to vibration based monitoring systems for the gearbox, generator and drive train. There are many forms and types of condition monitoring systems now available for wind turbines. A survey of commercially available condition monitoring systems and their associated costs has been undertaken for the blades, drive train and tower. This paper considers what value can be obtained from these systems if they are used correctly. This is achieved by running simulations on an operations and maintenance model for a 20 year life cycle wind farm. The model uses Hidden Markov Models to represent both the actual system state and the observed state. The costs for system failures are derived, as are possible reductions in these costs due to early detection. Various scenarios are simulated including the addition of condition monitoring systems to the drive train and blade and tower monitoring. Finally, the efﬁcacy of these systems is examined and its effect on operation costs.","B","181","E & F & G","18/02/15","100","true","","5.0E-4","0.0632","6.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","0.0072","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0035","0.6152","0.2651","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0013","0.0377","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4443","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0252","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","0.0575","0.0071","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4353","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.0117","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0022","0.001","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"62","The application of metabolomic profiling to the effects of physical activity","Physical activity and exercise are potent lifestyle interventions for the reduction of several psychosomatic risks, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mild-to-moderate depression. The current review describes the studies which have utilised a metabolomics/ metabolite profiling approach in combination with exercise in the period between 1999-2014 in predominantly healthy subjects (N:64) and in a smaller subset of patient cohorts (N:10) between 2011-2014. A broad range of intervention types were used in both healthy and patient cohorts with varying exercise regimes with or without supplement use. Effects on purine metabolism, which have been known for over 40 years, were by far the most well-cited and persistent finding. Other reported effects included observations of: glucocorticoid and androgen metabolism, glycolysis and Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation and pantothenic acid, amino acid oxidation, tryptophan metabolism and effects on microbiome metabolites. The discussion section draws observations from the very disparate studies together and links them to the general aspects of human metabolism.","C","765","H","12/04/19","97","true","","0.0038","0.0096","0.3264","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0049","0.0011","0.0912","0.0024","9.0E-4","0.1431","0.0011","0.0828","0.2078","0.1197","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0023","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0044","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","0.001","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2446","6.0E-4","0.0969","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0086","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1565","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2148","0.2326","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0196","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0045","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"63","Transgenic analysis of the Leishmania MAP kinase MPK10 reveals an auto-inhibitory mechanism crucial for stage-regulated activity and parasite viability","Protozoan pathogens of the genus Leishmania have evolved unique signaling mechanisms that can sense changes in the host environment and trigger adaptive stage differentiation essential for host cell infection. The signaling mechanisms underlying parasite development remain largely elusive even though Leishmania mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been linked previously to environmentally induced differentiation and virulence. Here, we unravel highly unusual regulatory mechanisms for Leishmania MAP kinase 10 (MPK10). Using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that MPK10 is stage-specifically regulated, as its kinase activity increases during the promastigote to amastigote conversion. However, unlike canonical MAPKs that are activated by dual phosphorylation of the regulatory TxY motif in the activation loop, MPK10 activation is independent from the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue, which is largely constitutive. Removal of the last 46 amino acids resulted in significantly enhanced MPK10 activity both for the recombinant and transgenic protein, revealing that MPK10 is regulated by an auto-inhibitory mechanism. Over-expression of this hyperactive mutant in transgenic parasites led to a dominant negative effect causing massive cell death during amastigote differentiation, demonstrating the essential nature of MPK10 auto-inhibition for parasite viability. Moreover, phosphoproteomics analyses identified a novel regulatory phospho-serine residue in the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain at position 395 that could be implicated in kinase regulation. Finally, we uncovered a feedback loop that limits MPK10 activity through dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the TxY motif. Together our data reveal novel aspects of protein kinase regulation in Leishmania, and propose MPK10 as a potential signal sensor of the mammalian host environment, whose intrinsic pre-activated conformation is regulated by auto-inhibition.","D","747","I & J","19/07/19","185","true","","0.0044","0.0125","5.0E-4","0.0014","4.0E-4","0.0014","0.0052","0.001","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.6842","7.0E-4","0.0068","0.1739","0.0692","0.0012","0.0021","0.0096","0.0017","0.0239","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0101","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0079","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.1145","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0016","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2031","6.0E-4","0.0022","3.0E-4","0.0097","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.4663","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0107","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0278","0.001","1.0E-4","0.0504","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0847","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"64","Dabigatran - a continuing exemplar case history demonstrating the need for comprehensive models to optimize the utilization of new drugs","Background: There are potential conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially where there are effectiveness, safety and/or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies showed dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. These concerns resulted in extensive activities pre- to post-launch to manage its introduction. Objective: To (i) review authority activities across countries, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications based on post-launch activities. Methodology: (i) Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran, (ii) development of guidance for key stakeholder groups through an iterative process, (iii) refining guidance following post launch studies. Results: Plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, centering on three pillars of pre-, peri-, and post-launch activities. Post-launch activities include increasing use of patient registries to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in clinical practice. Conclusion: Models for introducing new drugs are essential to optimize their prescribing especially where concerns. Without such models, new drugs may be withdrawn prematurely and/or struggle for funding. © 2014 Godman, Malmström, Diogene, Jayathissa, McTaggart, Cars, Alvarez-Madrazo, Baumgärtel, Brzezinska, Bucsics, Campbell, Eriksson, Finlayson, Fürst, Garuoliene, Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea, Hviding, Herholz, Joppi, Kalaba, Laius, Malinowska, Pedersen, Markovic-Pekovic, Piessnegger, Selke, Sermet, Spillane, Tomek, Vončina, Vlahović-Palčevski, Wale, Wladysiuk, van Woerkom, Zara and Gustafsson.","E","797","K & L & M","04/02/18","226","true","","4.0E-4","0.1992","0.1557","0.0054","0.0034","0.0997","9.0E-4","0.0015","3.0E-4","0.0591","0.0017","0.0207","0.249","0.1775","5.0E-4","0.0075","0.016","8.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","0.0081","0.001","0.0018","0.0116","0.01","3.0E-4","0.0017","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0064","0.0612","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","0.0073","0.0057","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0653","0.1666","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0023","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3264","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.005","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.007","1.0E-4","0.0087","3.0E-4","0.013","0.2822","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"65","Development of a learning task for a process-oriented diagnostics of developmental speech sound disorders: a pilot study","Differential diagnosis and treatment planning of speech sound disorders (SSD) is one of the major bottlenecks in the field of pediatric speech-language pathology. The current study comprised the development and evaluation of a learning task designed to provide insight in different (sub-)processes involved in the acquisition of sensori-motor representations of novel speech sound units. Six normally developing children (aged 4.1-7.8 yrs) and five children with SSD (aged 4.3-7.5 yrs) participated in the pilot study. The learning paradigm comprised a repetition task of three speech sound units that are not present in the children’s mother tongue ([g], [ʃ], and the consonant cluster /ml/, followed by [a]) in four conditions of repetition and variation. Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of learning as well as significant differences between groups, but no group by learning interactions. Detailed analysis of the individual data show underlying profiles to vary widely per child with SSD. Furthermore, results highlighted the role of prosody in SSD, suggesting a trade-off between accuracy at the segmental and supra-segmental levels. These preliminary results are promising for the profiling of SSD and suggest that a detailed assessment of the acquisition of novel sensori-motor representations may provide direct starting points for therapy.","B","826","M & A","03/10/16","129","true","","5.0E-4","0.0436","0.2848","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1515","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0021","7.0E-4","0.0012","0.0011","0.0612","0.4236","0.0011","0.0014","0.0147","0.0088","0.0017","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0026","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.036","0.0016","0.1494","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4042","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.062","0.0076","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1243","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.002","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.1754","3.0E-4","0.0023","2.0E-4","0.0197","1.0E-4","0.0027","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4"
"66","Dynamic optimal power flow for active distribution networks","Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation.Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes. Optimizing the operation of these schemes requires consideration of inter-temporal linkages as well as network power flow effects. Network effects are included in Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of Dynamic Optimal Power Flow before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with inter-temporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of non-firm connected generation, Principles of Access for non-firm generators, energy storage and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.","D","276","B & C","29/03/15","141","true","","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0452","0.0746","0.3571","7.0E-4","0.034","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.4834","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3975","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0669","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0478","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3893","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0803","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0084","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002"

"68","The role of customer engagement behavior in value co-creation: a service system perspective","Recent developments in marketing highlight the blurring of boundaries between firms and customers. The concept of customer engagement aggregates the multiple ways customer behaviors beyond transactions may influence the firm. However, the term is embryonic and academics and practitioners alike lack understanding on how customer engagement contributes to value co-creation. This paper marks the first attempt to conceptualize the role of customer engagement behavior (CEB) in value co-creation within a multi-stakeholder service system. We combine the theoretical perspectives of customer engagement and value co-creation research to the analysis of a rich case study of a public transport service system involving consumers, communities, businesses, and governmental organizations. Our findings describe drivers for CEB, identify four types of CEB, and explore the value outcomes experienced by various stakeholders. This paper proposes that CEB affects value co-creation by virtue of customers’ diverse resource contributions towards the focal firm and/other stakeholders that modify and/or augment the offering, and/or affect other stakeholders’ perceptions, preferences, expectations or actions towards the firm or its offering. Through inducing broader resource integration, CEB makes value co-creation a system level process. We offer nine research propositions explicating the connections CEB has to value co-creation by focal customers, the focal firm and other stakeholders. Our research suggests that firms focus greater attention on the resources that customers can contribute, explore the potential to engage diverse stakeholders around a common cause and employ organically emerging systems which provide opportunities for more extensive value co-creation.","E","276","E & F","20/05/17","152","true","","0.004","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.015","0.0209","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0012","0.7552","0.1115","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0877","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0673","2.0E-4","0.0058","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.005","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.102","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0075","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0015","0.0191","0.5252","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0028","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0135","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2404"

"170","Impact assessment of Scottish independence on the space sector","This politically neutral work explores the impact of independence on Scotland’s emerging, innovative and world leading civilian space sector. The ecosystem is explained and quantified, clarifying the distinction between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union, which the White Paper, Scotland’s Future, has blurred. Aspects of the White Paper relating to the sector are highlighted and discussed. The proposed relationship between an independent  Scotland (iScotland) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) is unclear within the White Paper. As the spirit adopted in the White Paper is wherever possible to continue co-operation with existing UK bodies this scenario is considered, with membership of ESA via UKSA, alongside direct membership of ESA. Scottish independence could be said to be worth £15 – 20 million per year to the sector in the medium-term, and the long-term size and scale of the sector may be of order £100 million; almost triple the current size. However, this is dependent on the relationship established between iScotland and the rest-of-the-UK (rUK), and appears to require a contravention of the spirit of the White Paper. How iScotland chooses to maintain a formal relationship with UKSA is thus of vital importance, having both economic and legal implications. Seeking a continuing relationship would require agreement about delegation of ministerial power, sovereign funds and indemnity provisions in response to any government liability for damage. As regards membership of ESA and EUMETSAT in particular, the existing member states are required to agree to accession by iScotland and to set the conditions; any disruption or lack of access to international organisations, including the EU, could be a potentially significant problem. Post-independence, the scope of UK nationality, as opposed to citizenship, would also require clarification in the context of space and any on-going relationship with UKSA.

The relationship with EUMETSAT via co-funding contributions to the Met Office requires further thought but does appear in principle to be a viable option. The same judgement of ‘viable’ can be reached when considering the Scottish government’s proposals around the Research Councils. However, whilst an approach may be viable, no assessment or judgement is offered as to its desirability from either an iScottish or rUK perspective.","B","811","A & G","30/04/18","193","true","","0.001","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.073","0.1801","0.0028","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0053","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.4055","0.2815","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0478","3.0E-4","0.0845","0.0023","0.1025","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1116","1.0E-4","0.0285","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.018","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2169","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0043","1.0E-4","0.0791","0.004","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3364","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0018"
"171","Counselling versus low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent sub-threshold and mild depression (CLICD): study protocol for a pilot/feasibility randomised controlled trial","Persistent sub-threshold depressive symptoms are important because almost all patients who experience symptoms for more than 2 years go on to develop major depressive episodes. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom recommends research into the efficacy of person centred counselling and low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent sub-threshold and mild depression. A two-arm, parallel group, pilot randomised trial to test the key components of trial delivery. The participants will be 50 patients with the diagnosis of persistent sub-threshold depressive symptoms and mild depression, recruited at five general practices in Glasgow, Scotland. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either Person-Centred Counselling (PCC) or Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (LI-CBT). The primary outcome measures are recruitment, adherence and retention rates at six months from baseline. The secondary outcome measures are changes at 6 months on GRID-HAMD-17; recovery from, or prevention of, depression according to DSM-IV diagnosis at 6 months; changes at 6 months on the PHQ-9, WSAS, EQ5D, and SF12v2 MH Enhanced. We will provide estimates, with adequate precision, to help design future studies, of the recruitment rate and the proportion followed-up at 6 months; and identify potential moderators of outcome. Evidence of comparative effectiveness of commonly used psychological treatments such as person-centred counselling and low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy is lacking in patients with sub-threshold and mild depression. This study will provide the information needed to construct a trial comparing these two treatments. This would help to inform early intervention treatment strategies for these conditions.","C","528","H & L","18/03/18","174","true","","4.0E-4","0.0012","0.4334","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1966","8.0E-4","0.0239","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.002","4.0E-4","0.0045","0.1418","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1731","6.0E-4","0.0038","0.0161","3.0E-4","0.0013","3.0E-4","0.0011","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1084","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0442","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1846","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0051","0.1236","5.0E-4","0.0255","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0034","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0603","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0087","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4093","1.0E-4","0.0017","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0156","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"

We monitored the process of setting up an Android device, and have identified a number of design weaknesses in the implementation of a number of Google services features which come pre-installed on virtually every Android device on sale today, which could permit skilled and capable attackers to carry out persistent attacks against Android users.","A","757","C","22/05/17","86","true","","0.0013","5.0E-4","0.0012","0.0054","0.0695","0.0206","0.0017","0.001","0.0046","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.1703","0.377","0.001","0.0243","0.1137","0.0014","0.2047","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1542","3.0E-4","0.001","9.0E-4","0.0023","1.0E-4","0.0018","0.001","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0379","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.004","5.0E-4","0.0183","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4163","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0028","0.0036","3.0E-4","0.0493","4.0E-4","0.1718","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0043","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0541","2.0E-4","0.0655","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"174","An analytic approach to modeling the optical response of anisotropic nanoparticle arrays at surfaces and interfaces","Anisotropic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with useful optical properties, such as localized plasmon resonances (LPRs), can be grown by self-assembly on substrates. However, these systems often have significant dispersion in NP dimensions and distribution, which makes a numerical approach to modeling the LPRs very difficult. An improved analytic approach to this problem is discussed in detail and applied successfully to NP arrays from three systems that differ in NP metal, shape and distribution, and in substrate and capping layer. The materials and anisotropic NP structures that will produce LPRs in desired spectral regions can be determined using this approach.","E","836","B & E","07/05/15","65","true","","0.0054","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0018","0.3477","0.0027","7.0E-4","0.0016","0.0895","0.0034","0.0262","0.4955","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0208","0.0017","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2197","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.03","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0025","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0012","1.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.488","0.0017","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1821","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0452","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0144","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"175","Fact and Fictions in Fx Arbitrage Processes","The efficient markets hypothesis implies that arbitrage opportunities in markets such as those for foreign exchange (FX) would be, at most, short-lived. The present paper surveys the fragmented nature of FX markets, revealing that information in these markets is also likely to be fragmented. The “quant” workforce in the hedge fund featured in The Fear Index novel by Robert Harris would have little or no reason for their existence in an EMH world. The four currency combinatorial analysis of arbitrage sequences contained in Cross, Kozyakin, O’Callaghan, Pokrovskii and Pokrovskiy (2012) is then considered. Their results suggest that arbitrage processes, rather than being self-extinguishing, tend to be periodic in nature. This helps explain the fact that arbitrage dealing tends to be endemic in FX markets.","A","920","E & F","11/11/17","67","true","","0.0054","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.1762","0.0552","0.0016","0.001","0.0015","0.0063","0.0013","0.0012","0.4428","0.2637","6.0E-4","0.0357","0.0011","9.0E-4","0.0036","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0042","0.0306","2.0E-4","0.0019","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0015","0.0153","0.0115","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0042","0.0045","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2825","9.0E-4","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0095","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0048","0.0031","0.3393","3.0E-4","0.0568","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.0036","0.0021","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.2097"
"176","Determinants of European national men’s football team performance: Scotland's potential progress in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers","In this paper, we estimate the potential outcomes for Scotland in the 2016 Euro qualifiers, based on a model of the outcomes of previous European men's football matches. The sampled dataset includes all matches played between European national men’s football teams between August 2012 and December 2013, that is 368 matches in all. According to our model, Scotland should fail to progress to the UEFA Euro 2016 playoffs by only one goal in Group D. This result is confirmed when we correct our model to take into account the difference between real scores and scores provided by the model for each team in Group D. Nevertheless, in a third model – which is a better predictor – Scotland should come third in Group D and thus proceed to the playoffs in which it could hope to qualify for the Euro 2016 Finals. A fourth and final approach predicts that Scotland could even come second in Group D, behind Germany, and thus qualify directly to the UEFA Euro 2016 Finals in France.","B","858","F & K","24/06/18","87","true","","5.0E-4","0.0033","0.1288","0.1038","0.0772","0.3112","7.0E-4","0.0019","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0019","0.003","0.364","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0011","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0558","0.0015","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0019","0.2045","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1298","0.0038","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.354","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.001","0.0518","0.0311","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0118","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1398","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0017","0.0012","0.0016","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4"

"178","Seasonal and spatial patterns of picophytoplankton growth, grazing and distribution in the East China Sea","Dynamics of picophytoplankton population distribution in the East China Sea (ECS), a marginal sea in the western North Pacific Ocean, were studied during two cruises in August 2009 (summer) and January 2010 (winter). Dilution experiments were conducted during the two cruises to investigate the growth and grazing among picophytoplantkon populations. Comparisons of phytoplankton growth (μ0) and microzooplankton grazing rates (m) on seasonal (summer and winter), spatial (plume, transitional and Kuroshio regions) and vertical (surface and depth of chlorophyll maximum) scales were made. The three picophytoplankton populations occupied different ecological niches and showed different distribution patterns (especially in summer), which is, however, not coincident with their maximum growth rate. The distribution and population transition of picophytoplankton is therefore a result of the balance between growth and grazing mortality. Average growth rates (μ0) for Prochlorococcus (Pro), Synechococcus (Syn) and picoeukaryotes (Peuk) were 0.36, 0.81 and 0.90 d−1 in summer, and 0.46, 0.58 and 0.56 d−1 in winter, respectively. Average grazing mortality rates (m) were 0.46, 0.63 and 0.68 d−1 in summer, and 0.25, 0.22 and 0.23 d−1 in winter for Pro, Syn and Peuk, respectively. The spatial pattern of both growth and grazing mortality rates showed decreasing trends from the inshore to offshore region, indicating a strong influence of the nutrient gradient induced by Yangtze River input. In summer, Pro, Syn and Peuk were dominant in Kuroshio, transitional and plume regions, respectively, while in winter all the three populations tended to thrive in the offshore regions, particularly for Pro and Syn. Vertically, picophytoplankton exhibited the highest abundance at ~ 20 m in summer and at the surface in winter. Both growth rate and grazing mortality were higher at the surface than in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. On average, protist grazing consumed 84, 79 and 74% and 45, 47 and 57% of production for Pro, Syn and Peuk in summer and winter, respectively.","D","407","B & L","17/11/17","168","true","","0.0022","0.0523","0.0739","0.3926","3.0E-4","0.004","0.0058","0.0032","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0192","0.0057","0.0051","0.307","0.095","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0319","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1634","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0138","0.0409","0.0542","1.0E-4","0.0153","1.0E-4","0.0021","0.0305","0.0961","1.0E-4","0.2895","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2017","0.004","0.0021","5.0E-4","0.0049","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","5.0E-4","0.0084","5.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0542","0.0073","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"179","Enhanced inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes by exposure to 405 nm light under sub-lethal temperature, salt and acid stress conditions","The antimicrobial effects of 405 nm light have generated interest in its use as an emerging disinfection technology with potential food-related applications. The aim of this study was to assess the bactericidal efficacy of 405 nm light for inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes under sub-lethally stressed environmental conditions. Bacteria were exposed to 405 nm light from a light emitting diode (LED) array under various temperature, salt (NaCl) and acid conditions to determine if bacterial susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation is affected when exposed under these conditions. Non-stressed bacterial populations (105 CFU/mL) were exposed to increasing doses of 405 nm light (~ 70 mW/cm2) and the inactivation results were compared with those generated under stress conditions. Bacteria were held at various temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C and 45 °C), acid concentrations (pH 3, 3.5 and 7) and salt concentrations (0%, 0.8%, 10% and 15% NaCl), and simultaneously exposed to 405 nm light. Enhanced inactivation of both E. coli and L. monocytogenes was achieved when light exposure was combined with each of the sub-lethal stresses, with significantly increased inactivation rates compared to non-stressed populations (P ≤ 0.05). One exception was with L. monocytogenes when light-exposed in the presence of 15% salt, as this combination reduced bacterial inactivation. The greatest enhancement of 405 nm light inactivation for both bacterial species was achieved when light exposure was combined with sub-lethal acid stress conditions at pH 3. This was demonstrated by a 5-log10 reduction of E. coli following a 405 nm light dose of 84 J/cm2 compared to 378 J/cm2 for non-stressed populations (77% reduction in dose) and by a 5-log10 reduction of L. monocytogenes achieved with a dose of 42 J/cm2 which corresponded to 50% of the dose required for the equivalent reduction of non-stressed populations. This acid-enhanced 405 nm light inactivation effect was demonstrated with E. coli and L. monocytogenes when dispersed in liquid suspension and when deposited on a test surface. Overall, results from this study have shown that sub-lethally stressed bacteria have increased susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation, thereby providing a synergistic inactivation effect, findings which increase the potential of this new light-based decontamination technology for food related applications.","C","402","E & A","01/10/15","209","true","","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0077","4.0E-4","0.0011","0.3255","0.0755","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3045","5.0E-4","0.0117","0.2193","0.0038","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0474","1.0E-4","0.0543","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2374","0.0494","0.0842","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0188","0.0132","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0093","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0043","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.482","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0413","1.0E-4","4.0E-4"

Almost all of today's devices, however, have been designed using slow and ineffective brute-force search methods, leading in many cases to limited device performance. In this article, we provide a complete demonstration of our recently proposed inverse design technique, wherein the user specifies design constraints in the form of target fields rather than a dielectric constant profile, and in particular we use this method to demonstrate a new demultiplexing grating. The novel grating, which has not been developed using conventional techniques, accepts a vertical-incident Gaussian beam from a free-space and separates O-band (1300 nm) and C-band (1550 nm) light into separate waveguides. This inverse design concept is simple and extendable to a broad class of highly compact devices including frequency filters, mode converters, and spatial mode multiplexers.","C","739","L & K & C","10/08/15","87","true","","0.0424","0.0011","7.0E-4","0.0016","0.0013","0.0035","0.301","0.007","0.0029","0.0013","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.04","0.3855","7.0E-4","0.1295","5.0E-4","0.035","0.045","5.0E-4","0.0192","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066","0.0068","0.0241","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0994","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.002","0.0023","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","0.0086","6.0E-4","0.0079","4.0E-4","0.0117","1.0E-4","0.3673","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0029","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.2474","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.1061","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0532","0.0123","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0057","2.0E-4","0.0038","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","8.0E-4"
"71","Tuning the adsorption of aromatic molecules on platinum via halogenation","The interaction of aromatic molecules with metal surfaces is of key relevance for the functionality of molecular electronics and organic electronics devices. One way to control and tune the binding properties of molecules to metals is chemical functionalization. The adsorption of halogenated benzene molecules on the (111) surface of platinum is here investigated by density functional theory calculations with nonlocal van der Waals correlation functional. It is found that these systems exhibit a bistable adsorption energy profile with (meta)stable chemisorption and physisorption states separated by a potential energy barrier. The relative stability of these states can be tuned by functionalizing benzene with a different number or type of halogen atoms. Our results suggest a simple rational molecular design to achieve the desired interfacial binding in organic electronic devices and in composites with interfaces between large aromatic molecules and metals.","D","529","A & D","01/06/19","89","true","","0.034","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0014","0.0765","0.3996","0.0317","4.0E-4","0.0122","0.0268","0.0048","0.4065","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.002","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1484","0.0011","0.0196","2.0E-4","0.0038","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0595","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","0.0098","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.2571","1.0E-4","0.2367","0.0023","0.2193","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0039","7.0E-4","0.0014","2.0E-4","0.0134","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0119","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4"

The budgets of Britain’s public services have been under sustained pressure and public libraries are no exception to public spending cuts in today’s “age of austerity”. Librarians increasingly try to supplement shrinking budgets by employing a variety of income generation methods. But are these methods always in line with the public library ethos? This article presents data showing what British librarians hold to be the public library ethos, what they undertake to generate extra income to maintain public library services and whether they think that their efforts to generate additional income are ever in contradiction to the public library ethos. The article is based on survey and interview data produced in 2013 and also provides, in a Supplementary File, a comprehensive list of income generation methods.

"74","Comparing text-based and dependence-based approaches for determining the origins of bugs","Identifying bug origins – the point where erroneous code was introduced – is crucial for many software engineering activities, from identifying process weaknesses to gathering data to support bug detection tools. Unfortunately, this information is not usually recorded when fixing bugs, and recovering it later is challenging. Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs – achieving 29–79% precision and 40–70% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins. Some potential improvements are explored in detail and identify pragmatic strategies for combining techniques along with simple modifications. Even after adopting these improvements, there remain many challenges: large commits, unrelated changes and long periods between origins and fixes all reduce effectiveness.","B","814","A","23/10/15","117","true","","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0021","0.0025","0.001","0.0462","0.0017","0.0021","0.003","0.0028","0.0064","0.0031","0.2555","0.5988","0.0143","0.0076","0.0455","0.0012","0.005","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015","0.002","0.0013","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0031","1.0E-4","0.0057","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.005","0.0012","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.5405","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1278","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1931","1.0E-4","0.0012","6.0E-4","0.0012","0.0013","0.0911","3.0E-4","0.0023","0.012","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4"
"75","A robust, precise and flexible tracking algorithm based on IMS and SWAD","The improved mean shift (IMS) algorithm can effectively track a colour target undergoing fast motion and complete occlusion. Instead template matching based on the sum of weighted absolute differences (SWAD) can track a target precisely, even under partial occlusion. To take advantage of both trackers, this paper presents a novel tracking algorithm that, on one side, further improves the IMS and extends it to a more general and flexible framework; on the other side, the proposed algorithm incorporates SWAD minimisation to increase the precision of the tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate that such an algorithm can robustly and precisely track targets with fast motion and in complete occlusion, more than conventional mean shift, IMS and SWAD-based trackers taken separately.","A","367","G & H","13/01/15","76","true","","0.0028","0.0011","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.003","0.0046","0.0017","0.0021","0.1127","0.0359","8.0E-4","0.0044","0.6061","0.0013","0.0914","4.0E-4","0.0057","0.1248","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0354","3.0E-4","0.1309","2.0E-4","0.0175","0.0017","0.0022","2.0E-4","0.0052","0.001","2.0E-4","0.0038","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.2277","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.5183","0.0012","0.0015","0.0021","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.004","5.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0048","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0239","0.0013","0.0034","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0024","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"76","TMP (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide)-aluminate bases: lithium-mediated alumination or lithiation-alkylaluminium-trapping reagents?","The lithium TMP-aluminate bases ""LiTMP·Al(iBu) 3"" 1 and ""LiTMP·Al(TMP)(iBu) 2"" 2, where TMP is 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide, have recently come under the spotlight as ""aluminating"" reagents in that they can perform aluminium-hydrogen exchange on a wide variety of aromatic substrates. Previous studies have intimated that 1 existed as a single species in THF solution formulated as [(THF)·Li(μ-TMP)(μ-iBu)Al( iBu)2] 1·THF, having a contacted ion pair structure as evidenced by an X-ray crystallographic study of isolated crystals. But here using anisole as a case substrate it is revealed that pre-crystallised 1·THF cannot deprotonate anisole at all whether in hexane or THF solution contradicting earlier in situ applications of 1 which revealed near quantitative metallation of anisole. NMR spectroscopic studies of 1 made in situ in THF solution ascribe this reactivity distinction from 1·THF to complex equilibria involving five major species in LiTMP·THF, Al( iBu)3·THF, [{Li(THF)4} +{Al(TMP)(iBu)3}-] 1·(THF)4, [(THF)·Li(μ-TMP)(μ-OC4H 7)Al(iBu)2], 4, and (TMP)Al( iBu)2·THF. Reagent 2 in contrast is found to exist as only two separated homometallic species in LiTMP·THF and (TMP)Al( iBu)2·THF in THF solution. The constitutions of 1 and 2 in non-polar hexane solution are also revealed. With the aid of DFT calculations, discussion focuses on the fact that none of the aluminate species present in THF solutions of 1 or 2 can deprotonate/metallate anisole, instead the metallation processes appear to be LiTMP lithiations followed immediately by trapping by an alkylaluminium complex, in a metal exchange which drives the reaction to the product (arylaluminated) side.","A","800","I & C & M","16/09/18","169","true","","0.0016","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.005","0.0012","0.0034","0.0014","0.687","0.0051","3.0E-4","0.0021","4.0E-4","0.0246","0.1964","0.0687","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0697","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0101","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0025","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.003","4.0E-4","0.1515","0.0033","0.5989","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0682","0.023","1.0E-4","0.0015","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0485","0.0067","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"77","Attributable fraction of tobacco smoking on cancer using population-based nationwide cancer incidence and mortality data in Korea","Smoking is by far the most important cause of cancer that can be modified at the individual level. Cancer incidence and mortality rates in Korea are the highest among all Asian countries, and smoking prevalence in Korean men is one of the highest in developed countries. The purpose of the current study was to perform a systematic review and provide an evidence-based assessment of the burden of tobacco smoking-related cancers in the Korean population. Sex- and cancer-specific population-attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using the prevalence of ever-smoking and second-hand smoking in 1989 among Korean adults, respectively, and the relative risks were estimated from the meta-analysis of studies performed in the Korean population for ever-smoking and in the Asian population for passive smoking. National cancer incidence data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and national cancer mortality data from Statistics Korea for the year 2009 were used to estimate the cancer cases and deaths attributable to tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20,239 (20.9%) cancer incident cases and 14,377 (32.9%) cancer deaths among adult men and 1,930 (2.1%) cancer incident cases and 1,351 (5.2%) cancer deaths among adult women in 2009 in Korea. In men, 71% of lung cancer deaths, 55%-72% of upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus and larynx) cancer deaths, 23% of liver, 32% of stomach, 27% of pancreas, 7% of kidney and 45% of bladder cancer deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking. In women the proportion of ever-smoking-attributable lung cancer was 8.1%, while that attributable to second-hand smoking among non-smoking women was 20.5%. Approximately one in three cancer deaths would be potentially preventable through appropriate control of tobacco smoking in Korean men at the population level and individual level. For Korean women, more lung cancer cases and deaths were attributable to second-hand than ever-smoking. Effective control programs against tobacco smoking should be further developed and implemented in Korea to reduce the smoking-related cancer burden.","B","289","L","27/08/17","190","true","","3.0E-4","0.4555","0.0154","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.1416","0.0035","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0046","8.0E-4","0.039","0.2422","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0356","4.0E-4","0.0011","0.0565","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0014","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.002","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0033","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0014","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1784","0.0011","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1637","3.0E-4","0.0013","0.0109","0.2357","5.0E-4","0.0017","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1313","1.0E-4","0.0019","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1587","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.094","3.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4"

"181","Digital Brokering: Project Report","The digital brokering system is a new concept designed to connect those who need services with those who can provide them. This concept was proposed by Albyn Housing Association and the University of the Highlands and Islands, and accepted by the Digital Health & Care Institute as an Experience Lab, which took place in December 2014 in Inverness.The Experience Lab aimed to create a setting for stakeholders (service users, public sector, third sector and private businesses) to elicit issues around the deployment of a digital platform. Using Actor Network Mapping, the Lab focused on identifying existing practices and barriers of service provision, and exploring potential solutions for the digital brokering system.Several key findings emerged relating to the barriers faced by services users in relation to knowledge, accessibility and availability of services, which led to the identification of the opportunity for the software to function as a directory with high functionality offline as well as online. Additionally, the identification of unmet needs, service exchange and a skills bank represented how the software could have a role in connecting resources within communities. Findings included implications and recommendations regarding the responsibility of the moderator, the functionality and roll out of the software.","D","740","H & L","15/06/17","111","true","","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0156","0.3843","6.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.3635","0.2203","6.0E-4","0.0047","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.005","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0684","0.0365","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0025","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.105","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1342","0.0018","5.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.0883","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.4401","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0084","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0021","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0923","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0084"

Assuming the Sun always as first primary, the Earth and Venus are the second primary, and their relative models are coupled together with the view of defining heteroclinic connections. On suitable Poincare sections, solar sail sets are constructed to obtain transit conditions from LPOs of the departure dynamical system to either LPOs or DPOs of the arrival one. Starting from initial guesses that assume a constant attitude of the solar sail, an optimal control problem is formulated, encompassing a trade-off between minimum transfer time and minimum solar sail steering effort, and it is solved with a direct pseudospectral method. At the optimization stage, variable attitude solar sails are investigated, assuming spacecraft with different control capabilities.","B","451","D","14/08/18","101","true","","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.001","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.6253","4.0E-4","0.0013","0.0029","0.3465","3.0E-4","0.0054","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0133","2.0E-4","0.0346","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","7.0E-4","0.004","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2986","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0097","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.6398","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4"
"183","Implementation of an F-statistic all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in Virgo VSR1 data","We present an implementation of the F-statistic to carry out the first search in data from the Virgo laser interferometric gravitational wave detector for periodic gravitational waves from a priori unknown, isolated rotating neutron stars. We searched a frequency f(0) range from 100 Hz to 1 kHz and the frequency dependent spindown f(1) range from -1.6(f(0)/100 Hz) x 10(-9) Hz s(-1) to zero. A large part of this frequency-spindown space was unexplored by any of the all-sky searches published so far. Our method consisted of a coherent search over two-day periods using the F-statistic, followed by a search for coincidences among the candidates from the two-day segments. We have introduced a number of novel techniques and algorithms that allow the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm in the coherent part of the search resulting in a fifty-fold speed-up in computation of the F-statistic with respect to the algorithm used in the other pipelines. No significant gravitational wave signal was found. The sensitivity of the search was estimated by injecting signals into the data. In the most sensitive parts of the detector band more than 90% of signals would have been detected with dimensionless gravitational-wave amplitude greater than 5 x 10(-24).","C","824","C","21/09/17","107","true","","0.1503","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0012","0.0027","9.0E-4","0.0011","0.3764","0.0011","7.0E-4","0.002","0.4533","6.0E-4","0.0023","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0021","0.0035","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.007","1.0E-4","0.0483","8.0E-4","0.0011","0.0017","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0014","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0065","1.0E-4","0.0039","2.0E-4","0.284","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0245","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0847","0.5216","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0016","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"

In particular, the proposed method aims at reducing the changes in the image structure by intrinsically enclosing an edge-stop mechanism whose computational cost is comparable to the state-of-the-art multi-scale edge aware techniques.","D","283","E & F","06/01/19","84","true","","0.0402","0.0621","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0012","0.0015","0.006","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","0.0059","0.0544","0.6476","5.0E-4","0.0447","0.0546","0.0117","0.0656","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0079","0.04","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0032","2.0E-4","0.0062","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0099","7.0E-4","0.1204","1.0E-4","0.0019","1.0E-4","0.6639","0.0287","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0425","3.0E-4","0.0012","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0013","0.0171","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0137","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0224","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0029","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.007","2.0E-4","0.001"
"186","Hydrodynamic coupling in microbially mediated fracture mineralization: formation of self-organized groundwater flow channels","Evidence of fossilized microorganisms embedded within mineral veins and mineral-filled fractures has been observed in a wide range of geological environments. Microorganisms can act as sites for mineral nucleation and also contribute to mineral precipitation by inducing local geochemical changes. In this study, we explore fundamental controls on microbially induced mineralization in rock fractures. Specifically, we systematically investigate the influence of hydrodynamics (velocity, flow rate, aperture) on microbially mediated calcite precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that a feedback mechanism exists between the gradual reduction in fracture aperture due to precipitation, and its effect on the local fluid velocity. This feedback results in mineral fill distributions that focus flow into a small number of self-organizing channels that remain open, ultimately controlling the final aperture profile that governs flow within the fracture. This hydrodynamic coupling can explain field observations of discrete groundwater flow channeling within fracture-fill mineral geometries where strong evidence of microbial activity is reported.","B","820","F & K","07/02/17","114","true","","0.0041","0.0014","0.0465","0.0978","8.0E-4","0.0067","0.0022","0.1396","0.0671","2.0E-4","0.1238","0.1637","0.0145","0.3216","0.0025","7.0E-4","0.0016","0.0044","0.0014","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.004","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0176","5.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.0503","2.0E-4","0.1318","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0421","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.333","0.0137","0.1163","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0208","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0865","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0107","0.0012","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1564","2.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"187","Probing ""green"" industry enterprises in the UK: a new identification approach","There is a growing interest in innovation for sustainability and the development of green industries and green jobs. But how can green industries, green manufacturing jobs, and green goods innovation be measured? This paper probes current and recent attempts to define and measure these categories, with a focus on studies in the UK. We review the methods, estimates and trends contained in these studies. While these efforts have value, they also raise significant conceptual and measurement issues. The paper discusses a series of these issues and considers strategies to further refine the categorization and detection of green sector enterprises. A new identification approach is put forward using search term combinations and text mining to discern green goods sector companies. This method is tested through a search of small and medium-size green goods enterprises in the UK. Findings from our search approach are presented, along with a discussion of advantages and limitations.","C","368","M & I","12/05/17","89","true","","0.0022","4.0E-4","0.0016","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0017","0.023","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.001","0.47","0.3229","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0126","0.0029","0.1574","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1247","1.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0244","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","0.0063","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3098","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0627","0.4257","7.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0042","2.0E-4","0.0218","0.0017","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015","0.0026"
"188","Evidence for a role of executive functions in learning biology","Research examining cognition and science learning has focused on working memory but evidence implicates a broader set of executive functions.  The current study examined executive functions and learning of biology in young adolescents. Fifty-six participants, aged 12-13 years, completed tasks of working memory (Spatial Working Memory), inhibition (Stop-Signal), attention set-shifting (ID/ED), and planning (Stockings of Cambridge), from the CANTAB. They also participated in a biology teaching session, practical and assessment on the topic of DNA designed specifically for the current study which measured a) memory for biology facts taught and b) understanding of information learned in the practical. Linear regression analysis revealed that planning ability predicted performance on the factual assessment and both spatial working memory and planning were predictive of performance on the conceptual assessment. The findings suggest that planning ability is important in learning biological facts but that a broader set of executive functions are important for conceptual learning, highlighting the role of executive functions in understanding and applying knowledge about what is learned within science teaching.","E","855","B & L","08/03/15","116","true","","0.0116","0.0011","0.0907","5.0E-4","0.0011","0.3115","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0395","6.0E-4","0.2562","0.2085","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0116","0.0641","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0141","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0364","0.0427","0.0011","0.0887","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2015","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1193","0.0626","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0015","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3362","1.0E-4","0.001","0.0012","0.0109","0.0015","1.0E-4","0.0706","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"189","The Golgi S-acylation machinery comprises zDHHC enzymes with major differences in substrate affinity and S-acylation activity","S-acylation, the attachment of fatty acids onto cysteine residues, regulates protein trafficking and function, and is mediated by a family of “zDHHC” enzymes. The S-acylation of peripheral membrane proteins has been proposed to occur at the Golgi, catalysed by an S-acylation “machinery” that displays little substrate specificity. To advance understanding of how S-acylation of peripheral membrane proteins is handled by Golgi zDHHC enzymes, we have investigated interactions between a subset of four Golgi zDHHC enzymes and two S-acylated proteins, SNAP25 and Cysteine-String Protein (CSP). Our results uncover major differences in substrate recognition and S-acylation by these zDHHC enzymes. The Ankyrin-repeat (ANK) domains of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 mediated strong and selective interactions with SNAP25/CSP, whereas binding of zDHHC3 and zDHHC7 to these proteins was barely detectable. Despite this, zDHHC3/zDHHC7 could S-acylate SNAP25/CSP more efficiently than zDHHC17, whereas zDHHC13 lacked S-acylation activity toward these proteins. Overall, the results of this study support a model whereby dynamic intracellular localisation of peripheral membrane proteins is achieved by highly selective recruitment by a subset of zDHHC enzymes at the Golgi, combined with highly efficient S-acylation by other Golgi zDHHC-enzymes.","A","736","E & A","12/01/17","126","true","","6.0E-4","0.001","0.0014","0.001","8.0E-4","0.0069","0.003","0.0031","5.0E-4","0.0014","0.6913","5.0E-4","0.0068","0.2685","6.0E-4","0.0063","0.0016","4.0E-4","0.0029","0.0024","2.0E-4","0.0028","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0013","0.0242","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0164","0.002","1.0E-4","0.0068","1.0E-4","0.257","7.0E-4","0.0061","3.0E-4","0.1713","3.0E-4","0.0029","0.4535","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0305","0.0042","2.0E-4","0.0069","0.0011","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0013","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"80","'Plus ca change, plus la meme chose': researching and theorising the new, new technologies","Waves of ‘new technology’ have typically been accompanied by widespread speculation regarding their economic and social impacts. Most notably, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, computerisation and the microchip prompted cataclysmic predictions regarding their effects for employment. For example, the World Centre for Computer Sciences and Human Resources estimated that, by the end of the 1980s, as many as 50 million people would be displaced by new information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Braham, 1985, cited in Boreham et al., 2007: 3). In the aftermath of speculation on the ‘Information Revolution’, whether dystopian (Jenkins and Sherman, 1979) or utopian (Toffler, 1970), New Technology, Work and Employment was established as corrective and as a forum for theoretically informed, empirically grounded research on the impact of technological developments on work, employment and workplace social relations. In place of grand theorising, then, the journal set itself the more prosaic but robust social scientific objective of describing, mapping and analysing emerging realities.","A","480","A & B & C & D","15/11/18","92","true","","0.0049","4.0E-4","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.1349","0.2423","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0045","0.0092","5.0E-4","0.0057","0.4127","0.1735","5.0E-4","0.0013","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0053","6.0E-4","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0153","0.0041","2.0E-4","0.0025","5.0E-4","0.0014","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0019","2.0E-4","0.0012","0.0058","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0413","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.1503","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.1585","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0609","0.4981","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0343","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0062","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0047"
"81","The effect of noun phrase length on the form of referring expressions","The length of a noun phrase has been shown to influence choices such as syntactic role assignment (e.g., whether the noun phrase is realized as the subject or the object). But does length also affect the choice between different forms of referring expressions? Three experiments investigated the effect of antecedent length on the choice between pronouns (e.g., he) and repeated nouns (e.g., the actor) using a sentence-continuation paradigm. Experiments 1 and 2 found an effect of antecedent length on written continuations: Participants used more pronouns (relative to repeated nouns) when the antecedent was longer than when it was shorter. Experiment 3 used a spoken continuation task and replicated the effect of antecedent length on the choice of referring expressions. Taken together, the results suggest that longer antecedents increase the likelihood of pronominal reference. The results support theories arguing that length enhances the accessibility of the associated entity through richer semantic encoding.","B","486","E & F & G","06/10/18","86","true","","0.0027","0.0471","0.0112","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0311","0.0011","8.0E-4","0.0066","0.036","0.0175","0.0047","0.1551","0.6074","5.0E-4","0.0649","0.004","0.0014","0.001","0.0063","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0034","2.0E-4","0.002","3.0E-4","0.0015","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0015","0.0131","0.0071","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0033","0.0039","0.1118","0.0051","4.0E-4","0.5334","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0391","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0296","0.0755","0.0557","0.0211","0.0482","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0064","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","0.0149","0.0062","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0066"

Therefore, the two PRRP linkages of the GAE are individually movable with a single degree of freedom. The mobility of two types of GAEs was investigated with the method based on the screw theory. It has been proven that both types of GAEs are movable because the terminal constraints exerted to the common joint by the two linkages are equal.","D","341","I & J","12/07/15","66","true","","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0383","8.0E-4","0.0026","0.0031","0.0457","0.0307","0.1423","0.0883","0.0014","0.2127","0.0051","0.3105","6.0E-4","0.0014","0.0016","0.0019","0.112","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0013","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0117","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0051","0.0768","2.0E-4","0.0013","0.001","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.001","6.0E-4","0.0086","0.0015","3.0E-4","0.2993","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.004","0.0065","0.0012","0.1357","4.0E-4","0.0087","3.0E-4","0.001","0.1508","0.0013","0.0039","2.0E-4","0.0248","0.086","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1571","4.0E-4","5.0E-4"
"84","A novel technique to incorporate structural prior information into multi-modal tomographic reconstruction","There has been a rapid expansion of multi-modal imaging techniques in tomography. In biomedical imaging, patients are now regularly imaged using both single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and x-ray computed tomography (CT), or using both positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In non-destructive testing of materials both neutron CT (NCT) and x-ray CT are widely applied to investigate the inner structure of material or track the dynamics of physical processes. The potential benefits from combining modalities has led to increased interest in iterative reconstruction algorithms that can utilize the data from more than one imaging mode simultaneously. We present a new regularization term in iterative reconstruction that enables information from one imaging modality to be used as a structural prior to improve resolution of the second modality. The regularization term is based on a modified anisotropic tensor diffusion filter, that has shape-adapted smoothing properties. By considering the underlying orientations of normal and tangential vector fields for two co-registered images, the diffusion flux is rotated and scaled adaptively to image features. The images can have different greyscale values and different spatial resolutions. The proposed approach is particularly good at isolating oriented features in images which are important for medical and materials science applications. By enhancing the edges it enables both easy identification and volume fraction measurements aiding segmentation algorithms used for quantification. The approach is tested on a standard denoising and deblurring image recovery problem, and then applied to 2D and 3D reconstruction problems; thereby highlighting the capabilities of the algorithm. Using synthetic data from SPECT co-registered with MRI, and real NCT data co-registered with x-ray CT, we show how the method can be used across a range of imaging modalities.","E","171","K & L & M","21/10/17","171","true","","0.096","5.0E-4","0.0012","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0022","0.0298","4.0E-4","0.0055","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1009","0.0019","0.4599","4.0E-4","0.004","0.0592","0.2249","0.0076","0.005","2.0E-4","0.0379","2.0E-4","0.001","0.0431","0.0661","0.2163","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0459","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0022","0.0126","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0452","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0136","0.3633","0.0033","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.007","2.0E-4","0.0316","2.0E-4","0.0066","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.094","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0036","4.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"85","External lightning protection system for wind turbine blades: preliminary aerodynamic results","In general, there are three components making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an external down conductor is likely to reduce the risk of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an external down conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, external down conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of external down conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade profile (aerofoil) used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with external down conductors of 1mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m/s and 5˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that external down conductor arrangement could be considered.","B","748","M & A","03/10/19","115","true","","6.0E-4","0.142","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0024","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.0055","4.0E-4","0.0114","0.09","0.0066","0.3808","0.2114","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0042","0.1407","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0029","0.0031","1.0E-4","0.0012","2.0E-4","0.2849","6.0E-4","0.0013","7.0E-4","0.0035","0.0133","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0428","0.1748","0.0013","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3472","0.001","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0173","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0136","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0811","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0018","2.0E-4"
"86","Systematic design of the lead-lag network method for active damping in LCL-filter based three phase converters","Three-phase active rectifiers guarantee sinusoidal input currents and unity power factor at the price of a high switching frequency ripple. To adopt an LCL-filter, instead of an $L$-filter, allows using reduced values for the inductances and so preserving dynamics. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop if the present resonance is not properly damped. Passive damping simply adds resistors in series with the LCL-filter capacitors. This simplicity is at the expense of increased losses and encumbrances. Active damping modifies the control algorithm to attain stability without using dissipative elements but, sometimes, needing additional sensors. This solution has been addressed in many publications. The lead-lag network method is one of the first reported procedures and continues being in use. However, neither there is a direct tuning procedure (without trial and error) nor its rationale has been explained. Thus, in this paper a straightforward procedure is developed to tune the lead-lag network with the help of software tools. The rationale of this procedure, based on the capacitor current feedback, is elucidated. Stability is studied by means of the root locus analysis in $z$-plane. Selecting the lead-lag network for the maximum damping in the closed-loop poles uses a simple optimization algorithm. The robustness against the grid inductance variation is also analyzed. Simulations and experiments confirm the validity of the proposed design flow.","D","985","B & C","02/02/17","136","true","","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0086","7.0E-4","0.0019","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.001","0.0036","0.3919","3.0E-4","0.0122","0.0864","5.0E-4","0.489","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0215","2.0E-4","0.0033","2.0E-4","0.001","0.0019","0.0018","0.0025","1.0E-4","0.0187","0.007","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0047","4.0E-4","0.0187","0.0064","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3515","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0108","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0245","0.0081","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.452","0.0379","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0172","1.0E-4","0.0011"
"87","Combined wind turbine fatigue and ultimate load reduction by individual blade control","If each blade of the wind turbine has individual pitch actuator, there is possibility of employing the pitch system to mitigate structural loads through advanced control methods. Previously, considerable reduction of blade lifetime equivalent fatigue loads has been achieved by Individual Blade Control (IBC) and in addition, it has also been shown the potential in blade ultimate loads reduction. However, both fatigue and ultimate loads impact on the design and life of wind turbine blades. In this paper, the design and application of IBC that concurrently reduce both blade fatigue and ultimate loads is investigated. The contributions of blade load spectral components, which are 1P, 2P and edgewise mode from blade in-plane and/or out-of-plane bending moments, are firstly explored. Four different control options for reducing various combinations of these load components are compared. In response to the different spectral peaks of both fatigue and ultimate loads, the controller has been designed so that it can act on different frequency components which vary with wind speed. The performance of the IBC controller on fatigue and ultimate load reduction is assessed by simulating a 5MW exemplar wind turbine. Simulation results show that with a proper selection of controlling inputs at different wind speed, the use of a single combined IBC can achieve satisfactory reduction on both fatigue and ultimate loads.","A","699","B & C & D","29/03/19","134","true","","5.0E-4","0.3615","7.0E-4","0.0013","3.0E-4","0.0018","0.0245","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","0.0014","0.4127","0.1401","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0525","2.0E-4","0.0025","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0109","0.134","3.0E-4","0.0013","0.0189","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.3859","0.0014","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.291","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0039","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0099","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0044","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.125","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"

Exploratory study. Pen tip trajectories were recorded during circle, spiral and line drawing and repeated character 'elelelel' and sentence writing, performed by Parkinson patients and healthy control participants. Parkinson patients were tested after overnight withdrawal of anti-Parkinsonian medication.  University Medical Center Groningen, tertiary care, the Netherlands.  Patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 10; mean age 69.0 years; 6 male) and healthy controls (n = 10; mean age 68.1 years; 6 male).  Movement time and velocity to detect bradykinesia and the size of writing to detect micrographia. A rest recording to investigate the presence of a rest-tremor, by frequency analysis.  Mean disease duration in the Parkinson group was 4.4 years and the patients were in modified Hoehn-Yahr stages 1-2.5. In general, Parkinson patients were slower than healthy control participants. Median time per repetition, median velocity and median acceleration of the sentence task and median velocity of the elel task differed significantly between Parkinson patients and healthy control participants (all p<0.0014). Parkinson patients also wrote smaller than healthy control participants and the width of the 'e' in the elel task was significantly smaller in Parkinson patients compared to healthy control participants (p<0.0014). A rest-tremor was detected in the three patients who were clinically assessed as having rest-tremor.  This study shows that standardized handwriting can provide objective measures for bradykinesia, tremor and micrographia to distinguish Parkinson patients from healthy control participants.","E","694","E & F","08/05/18","168","true","","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.5358","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0474","0.0013","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0182","8.0E-4","0.0214","0.0016","0.1334","4.0E-4","0.0045","0.2296","0.0027","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.2886","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0083","0.0026","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0698","0.0319","0.0292","0.015","3.0E-4","0.0026","0.182","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.009","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0031","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0037","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3057","0.0057","0.0344","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"89","Perspectives on the past and the future: clients' views on UK service provision for adult stammering","Background: Client opinions are appropriate contributions to the design and evaluation of health care services. Adults who stammer (AWS) have previously informed discussion regarding speech and language therapy (SLT) services; however, contemporary UK perspectives are lacking.
Aim: This study aimed to identify features of helpful and unhelpful SLT services for AWS from the client and potential user perspective. Highlighting preferred components of therapy from this standpoint can help to ensure that SLT services are client-centred.
Methods: An online survey was conducted using questions largely derived from UK professional guidelines of minimum best practice. Responses were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Results: Both positive and negative aspects of individual and group therapy for AWS were identified. Ideal service characteristics related to ‘therapy and therapist’ and ‘service delivery’ issues. Results were generally consistent with previous similar studies. In addition, consideration of the place of remote
communication methods within therapy highlighted an appetite for such practice.
Conclusions: SLT facilitated long-term benefits for the majority of respondents, but future service design could incorporate greater flexibility in the: timing of therapy; therapeutic format; choice of therapist; and use of technology. The relevance of these findings for allied health services is acknowledged.","C","451","H & J","08/05/17","137","true","","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.034","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.3544","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","0.0019","5.0E-4","0.2882","0.1988","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1152","0.0012","0.0016","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0173","0.0027","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0064","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.2593","2.0E-4","0.0975","2.0E-4","0.0053","0.2325","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0063","1.0E-4","0.0012","7.0E-4","0.0076","2.0E-4","0.0433","0.2915","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0179","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","9.0E-4"

"191","The roles of the nucleus accumbens core, dorsomedial striatum, and dorsolateral striatum in learning: performance and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioned responses and instrumental avoidance responses","This study examined the effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core (NAc-co), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rats on the learning and extinction of Pavlovian and instrumental components of conditioned avoidance responses (CARs). None of the lesions caused sensorimotor deficits that could affect locomotion. Lesions of the NAc-co, but not DMS or DLS, decreased unconditioned and conditioned freezing. The NAc-co and DLS lesioned rats learned the 2-way active avoidance task more slowly. These results suggest: (i) CARs depend on both Pavlovian and instrumental learning; (ii) learning the Pavlovian component of CARs depends on the NAc-co; learning the instrumental component of CARs depends on the DLS, NAc and DMS; (iii) although the NAc-co is also needed for learning the instrumental component, it is not clear whether it plays a role in learning the instrumental component per se or if it simply allows learning of the Pavlovian component which is a pre-condition for learning the instrumental component; (iv) we did not find evidence that the DMS and DLS play the same roles in habit and goal-directed aspects of the instrumental component of CARs as observed in appetitive motivated instrumental responding.","C","483","H & L","24/10/18","128","true","","0.0015","0.0886","0.1418","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2219","0.0018","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0021","0.1719","0.0344","0.3169","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0128","0.0016","0.0012","5.0E-4","0.0051","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1109","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0037","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0191","0.0184","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0067","0.0019","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0046","0.0019","0.3334","0.001","8.0E-4","0.1727","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0045","0.004","2.0E-4","0.0014","0.0436","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0266","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.035","0.0028","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1938","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"

It is therefore both important and feasible to establish new breakdown parameters for assessing the appropriateness of a fluid description at the continuum level by utilizing kinetic information rather than macroscopic flow quantities alone. We propose a new kinetic criterion to indirectly assess the errors introduced by a continuum-level description of the gas flow. The analysis, which includes numerical demonstrations, focuses on the validity of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations and corresponding kinetic models and reveals that the new criterion can consistently indicate the validity of continuum-level modeling in both low-speed and high-speed flows at different Knudsen numbers.","A","624","C","28/04/16","75","true","","0.0013","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0018","7.0E-4","0.0142","0.0017","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.422","0.0064","0.5336","5.0E-4","0.0111","6.0E-4","0.0022","0.0013","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0032","4.0E-4","0.3908","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0029","2.0E-4","0.5022","0.0021","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","4.0E-4","0.0078","2.0E-4","0.0056","7.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0044","1.0E-4","0.0012","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0646","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"

"196","Thermal volatilisation analysis of a TDI-based flexible polyurethane foam containing ammonium polyphosphate","In this paper, we report a comprehensive study on a TDI-based foam containing 13% ammonium polyphosphate (APP) in order to examine the effect that this conventional fire retardant has on the thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation behaviour of the polyurethane foam. The results from TVA and TGA analyses show that the APP foam undergoes a significantly different degradation mechanism to the standard foam that we have reported on previously. The TGA results revealed the presence of a two-stage degradation process under a non-oxidative environment. The TVA results, on the other hand, revealed that degradation of the APP foam in fact occurs in four overlapping steps compared to the two-step process which occurs for the standard foam. The additional degradation steps observed for the APP foam are proposed to correspond to degradation of the fire retardant. Evolution of volatile material was also observed to occur at a lower temperature for the APP foam and it is proposed that the primary degradation of the urethane linkages via a depolycondensation reaction is acid-catalysed by the acidic hydroxyl groups which arise from degradation of APP. The sub-ambient differential distillation trace revealed that the nature and distribution of the volatiles evolved from the APP foam were profoundly different to the standard foam, which confirms that the secondary degradation is also altered in the presence of APP.","B","325","F & K","04/07/18","129","true","","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.1268","0.0056","5.0E-4","0.0011","0.0059","0.1273","0.0687","0.0015","0.001","0.1781","0.008","0.4015","0.0707","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0015","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0017","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.1821","5.0E-4","0.0034","0.0011","0.1536","2.0E-4","0.001","0.0014","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3749","0.0762","0.0173","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0023","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0183","0.018","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0407","0.0025","0.0078","2.0E-4","0.0137","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0757","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4"
"197","Sensitivity analysis of different capacity spectrum approaches to assumptions in the modeling, capacity and demand representations","Several capacity spectrum assessment methods exist for determination of structural performance of building models subjected to earthquake loading. The repetition of such analysis for earthquakes of increasing intensity will result in the derivation of analytical fragility functions. A comparison of three capacity spectrum assessment approaches (N2, SPO2IDA and FRACAS) has been carried out, highlighting the advantages and limitations of the approaches. Two experimental case studies have been chosen to evaluate the IM-EDP (Sa-Sd, ISDmax%) estimates obtained from the three different capacity spectrum procedures, as well as from non-linear time-history analyses (NLTHA). It is found that all three approaches perform well in estimating the response of a simple steel frame, but that FRACAS provides the best estimate of the response of an irregular reinforced concrete frame. It is concluded that further comparisons of the capacity spectrum approaches with large-scale experiments on structures are required to draw more general conclusions.","B","467","M & I","17/05/16","95","true","","0.0011","9.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0594","8.0E-4","0.0014","0.0023","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0275","0.6677","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.1917","0.0429","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0412","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0753","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.6366","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0018","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0734","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0393","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.12","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"198","Credit Conditions and Foreign Direct Investment During the Global Financial Crisis","This paper investigates the effect that tight credit conditions had on outward foreign direct investment flows during the 2008-2010 global financial crisis. A difference-in-differences approach is used to isolate a ""credit channel"" impact of the global financial crisis on foreign direct investment. The global financial crisis had a stronger negative impact on the relative volume of outward foreign direct investment in financially vulnerable sectors in more financially developed countries, especially if these countries also experienced a banking crisis. These results suggest that lack of access to external finance can partly explain the drop in foreign direct investment during the global financial crisis.","D","911","B & L","07/07/15","72","true","","0.0086","9.0E-4","0.0013","0.0056","0.2196","0.0077","0.0011","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0297","0.5066","0.2094","0.002","4.0E-4","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0021","0.0018","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0054","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0018","0.051","2.0E-4","0.0106","0.0014","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0014","2.0E-4","0.0027","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1781","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0141","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1047","3.0E-4","0.001","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.6151"
"199","A material-based platform to modulate fibronectin activity and focal adhesion assembly","We present a detailed characterization of fibronectin (FN) adsorption and cell adhesion on poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) and poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), two polymers with very similar physicochemical properties and chemical structure, which differ in one single methyl group in the lateral chain of the polymer. The globular solution conformation of FN was retained following adsorption onto PMA, whereas spontaneous organization of FN into protein (nano) networks occurred on PEA. This distinct distribution of FN at the material interface promoted a different availability, measured via monoclonal antibody binding, of two domains that facilitated integrin binding to FN: FNIII10 (RGD sequence) and FNIII9 (PHSRN synergy sequence). The enhanced exposure of the synergy domain on PEA compared to PMA triggered different focal adhesion assemblies: L929 fibroblasts showed a higher fraction of smaller focal plaques on PMA (40%) than on PEA (20%). Blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies against FNIII10 (HFN7.1) and FNIII9 (mAb1937) confirmed the ability of these polymeric substrates to modulate FN conformation. Overall, we propose a simple and versatile material platform that can be used to tune the presentation of a main extracellular matrix protein (FN) to cells, for applications than span from tissue engineering to disease biology.","C","437","E & A","14/01/18","132","true","","0.0034","7.0E-4","9.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0016","0.0671","0.003","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3475","0.1134","0.0099","0.3387","0.0076","0.0024","0.0146","0.0577","0.0291","0.0012","3.0E-4","0.352","3.0E-4","0.0043","3.0E-4","0.0155","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0863","4.0E-4","0.0021","2.0E-4","0.0013","0.0253","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0129","0.0017","5.0E-4","0.2378","0.0016","0.0014","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0075","0.1307","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0087","0.0059","4.0E-4","0.0138","0.0359","4.0E-4","0.0192","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0017","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002","0.0205","0.0037"
"90","Hearing in the crepuscular owl butterfly (Caligo eurilochus, Nymphalidae)","Tympanal organs are widespread in  Nymphalidae butterflies, with a great deal of variability in the morphology of these ears. How this variation reflects differences in hearing physiology is not currently understood. This study provides the first examination of the hearing organs of the crepuscular owl butterfly, Caligo eurilochus. We hypothesize that (1) its hearing may function to detect the high-frequency calls of bats, or (2) like its diurnal relatives it may function to detect avian predators, or (3) it may have lost auditory sensitivity as a result of the lack of selective pressures. To test these hypotheses we examined the tuning and sensitivity of the C. eurilochus Vogel’s organ using laser Doppler vibrometry and extracellular neurophysiology. We show that the C. eurilochus ear responds to sound and is most sensitive to frequencies between 1-4 kHz, as confirmed by both the vibration of the tympanal membrane and the physiological response of the associated nerve branches. In comparison to the hearing of its diurnally active relative, Morpho peleides, C. eurilochus has a narrower frequency range with higher auditory thresholds. We conclude that hearing in this butterfly is partially-regressed, and may reflect a trade-off between hearing and vision for survival in low light conditions.","C","807","L & K & C","03/08/18","111","true","","0.0023","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.012","0.0014","0.0186","0.1646","0.0271","4.0E-4","0.0013","0.0397","0.0013","0.0599","0.3249","0.0327","0.0365","0.0531","0.2216","0.0016","8.0E-4","0.0036","0.0041","0.0015","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0091","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0163","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0012","7.0E-4","0.1171","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0089","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.4033","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","9.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1444","0.0134","3.0E-4","0.0057","0.0176","0.001","0.0019","0.0014","0.1274","2.0E-4","0.0879","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0137","0.0012","0.0034","0.0059"

While non-heterosexuality is often associated with secularism, and some sources cast religion as automatically negative or harmful to the realisation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) identity (or ‘coming out’), we explore how queer Christian youth negotiate sexual–religious identities. There is a dearth of studies on queer religious youth, yet an emerging and continuing interest in the role of digital technologies for the identities of young people. Based on interviews with 38 LGBT, ‘religious’ young people, this article examines Facebook, as well as wider social networking sites and the online environment and communities. Engaging with the key concept of ‘online embodiment’, this article takes a closer analysis of embodiment, emotion and temporality to approach the role of Facebook in the lives of queer religious youth. Furthermore, it explores the methodological dilemmas evoked by the presence of Facebook in qualitative research with specific groups of young people.","D","783","A & D","16/08/16","113","true","","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2494","0.3944","0.0037","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3116","0.0258","0.0019","7.0E-4","0.0049","8.0E-4","0.0025","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0015","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0031","0.1307","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2023","0.0018","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0118","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0799","1.0E-4","0.1533","0.0066","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.3868","0.0053","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0028","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0026"

"93","Understanding patterns and processes in models of trophic cascades","Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators. The resulting trophic cascades have had profound effects on food webs, leading to significant economic and societal consequences. However, the strength of cascades – that is the extent to which a disturbance is diminished as it propagates through a food web - varies widely between ecosystems, and there is no formal theory as to why this should be so. Some food chain models reproduce cascade effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic “top-down” cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled “bottom-up” cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also depend on the inclusion of density-dependence, but especially on mortality regulation as a caricature of e.g. disease and parasite dynamics or intra-guild predation. We show that our conclusions, based on simple food chains, transfer to a more complex marine food web model in which cascades are induced by varying river nutrient inputs or fish harvesting rates.","A","664","E","18/08/16","117","true","","0.0249","0.117","6.0E-4","0.0728","0.0128","0.0015","0.0031","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1955","0.0026","0.2395","0.3131","0.0016","0.0121","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0137","0.0023","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0029","0.0116","2.0E-4","0.0036","5.0E-4","0.0069","0.345","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0064","1.0E-4","0.3317","0.0012","4.0E-4","0.003","0.0015","0.0584","6.0E-4","0.0244","0.0022","6.0E-4","0.0941","0.0015","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0034","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0119","5.0E-4","0.0326","3.0E-4","0.0337","4.0E-4"

The device uses fluidic displacement principles to accurately display the volume change experienced by an expanding membrane. This volume change is then used to calculate the peak deflection height of the membrane. The device has been fabricated using already well established dry film techniques commonly used in the field of microfluidics. Its simple design does not require any complex or expensive electronics and experimental results show the device's ability to record deflections over a range of membrane diameters down to a resolution of 38 μm. Simple geometry changes can allow nanoscale resolution measurements.

"96","Practical strategies to stabilize a nanosatellite platform with a space camera and integrated mechanical parts","The growth and speed of nanosatellite capabilities has led to an increasing demand on the respective attitude control systems. Typically, nanosatellites utilise minaturised reaction wheels for 3-axis stabilisation/manoeuvres, which are desaturated using magnetorquers. 

Small space telescopes have been deployed from nanosatellites in the past with capability ever increasing to push the limit of detectors.  Previous work has established the feasibility of achieving GSD of 0.7 m in low Earth orbit for a 2.5 U CubeSat using deployable mirrors from a 400 km orbit. 

The dynamic model of nanosatellite with the telescope + the deployed mirror systems will be built in this research work. The deployed mirror system will use a diamond turned mirror - it's an off axis paraboloid. The mirror would be light-weighted as much as possible, i.e. the back surface would be carved away with good thermal stability.  The mechanisms for mirror systems may use methods like minature geared motors, stiction motors and shape memory alloy hinges. The sensoring and directing of the mirror surface will use an image based detection methods. A closed loop control of the mirror position will be used to iterate to a fully aligned system. This work also considers control strategies to stabilise such a platform against the effects of firstly, the external aerodynamics and secondly, any internal disturbances induced by and the movement of focussing elements.  A pointing accuracy of 5-10 arcsec for a 20 min observation over the UK is targeted at a baseline orbit of 350 km sun-synchronous. 

Following an initial baseline to establish current state-of-art both based on in-orbit performance and off-the-shelf subsystems available to the market within the constraints of a 3U nanosatellite system, a number of feed-forward/feedback control loops and sensor systems are studied to determine a simple process for compensating for the motion.","A","930","I & C & M","29/11/17","172","true","","0.0037","0.0067","5.0E-4","0.0016","0.0067","0.0011","0.1433","0.0014","3.0E-4","0.2488","7.0E-4","0.0012","0.0315","0.3823","0.0013","0.0048","0.0093","0.0199","0.1349","0.0011","0.2509","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0053","7.0E-4","0.0659","0.0021","0.0011","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0122","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0023","0.0078","4.0E-4","0.0036","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.3569","0.0302","0.0051","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","0.0309","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0188","1.0E-4","0.0028","0.1344","0.0029","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0249","0.009","0.0243","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"
"97","Extrinsic tau-coupling and the regulation of interceptive reaching under varying task constraints","We investigated a general theory accounting for the guidance of ongoing movements in an interceptive reaching task. The aim was to assess the premise of tau-coupling that the coupling constant k, the ratio of taus(τs) of motion gaps between hand and object, reflects the kinematics of the on-going movement. The spatial and temporal constraints of the interceptive action were manipulated in three task conditions. While the time dependent counterpart of k, K(t) exhibited task effects, k itself could not distinguish between task manipulations. K(t) showed large variability during the initial acceleration phase, small variability during the rest of the movement, and task dependent changes during the final deceleration phase of interception. The findings highlight the importance of clarifying what constitutes as τ-coupling.","B","881","L","16/11/18","75","true","","0.0985","6.0E-4","8.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0221","0.0034","0.0043","0.0081","0.0019","0.007","0.007","0.0015","0.1894","0.4469","0.001","0.0056","0.1371","0.0015","0.0631","5.0E-4","0.0011","9.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0092","2.0E-4","0.0062","0.002","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0051","0.003","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0015","0.1172","2.0E-4","0.1157","5.0E-4","0.4626","6.0E-4","0.0177","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0146","0.0043","0.009","0.0014","5.0E-4","0.1858","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0023","0.0018","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0249","2.0E-4","0.0028","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.003"
"98","Radially polarized, half-cycle, attosecond pulses from laser wakefields through coherent synchrotron radiation","Attosecond bursts of coherent synchrotron-like radiation are found when driving ultrathin relativistic electron disks in a quasi-one-dimensional regime of wakefield acceleration, in which the laser waist is larger than the wake wavelength. The disks of overcritical density shrink radially due to the focusing wake fields, thus providing the transverse currents for the emission of an intense, radially polarized, half-cycle pulse of about 100 attoseconds in duration. The electromagnetic pulse first focuses to a peak intensity 10 times larger ($7\times10^{20}\rm W/cm^2$) than the driving pulse and then emerges as a conical beam. Saturation of the emission amplitudes is derived analytically and in agreement with particle-in-cell simulation. By making use of gas targets instead of solids to form the ultrathin disks, the new scheme allows for high repetition rate required for applications.","B","565","B & H","27/12/19","90","true","","0.7001","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0013","5.0E-4","0.0019","0.0862","0.0012","9.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.007","0.1838","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.001","0.0127","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.5979","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1212","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0011","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.1589","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0763","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0274","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0053","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4"
"99","Review of high-power ultrasound-industrial applications and measurement methods","Applications involving high-power ultrasound are expanding rapidly as ultrasonic intensification opportunities are identified in new fields. This is facilitated through new technological developments and an evolution of current systems to tackle challenging problems. It is therefore important to continually update both the scientific and commercial communities on current system performance and limitations. To achieve this objective, this paper addresses two key aspects of high-power ultrasonic systems. In the first part, the review of high-power applications focuses on industrial applications and documents the developing technology from its early cleaning applications through to the advanced sonochemistry, cutting, and water treatment applications used today. The second part provides a comprehensive overview of measurement techniques used in conjunction with high-power ultrasonic systems. This is an important and evolving field which enables design and process engineers to optimize the behaviour and/or operation of key metrics of system performance, such as field distribution or cavitation intensity.","C","240","D & L","25/07/16","99","true","","0.0011","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0046","0.0908","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0054","0.1861","0.4751","0.001","0.0023","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.2271","0.0022","0.0017","0.0016","2.0E-4","0.1191","2.0E-4","0.0101","7.0E-4","0.0015","1.0E-4","0.1044","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0105","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0046","2.0E-4","0.0013","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.408","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0012","3.0E-4","0.0015","2.0E-4","0.2813","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0335","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0034","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0067","0.0012","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4"
"100","Scaled experiment to investigate auroral kilometric radiation mechanisms in the presence of background electrons","Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) emissions occur at frequencies ∼300kHz polarised in the X-mode with efficiencies ∼1-2% [1,2] in the auroral density cavity in the polar regions of the Earth's magnetosphere, a region of low density plasma ∼3200km above the Earth's surface, where electrons are accelerated down towards the Earth whilst undergoing magnetic compression. As a result of this magnetic compression the electrons acquire a horseshoe distribution function in velocity space. Previous theoretical studies have predicted that this distribution is capable of driving the cyclotron maser instability. To test this theory a scaled laboratory experiment was constructed to replicate this phenomenon in a controlled environment, [3-5] whilst 2D and 3D simulations are also being conducted to predict the experimental radiation power and mode, [6-9]. The experiment operates in the microwave frequency regime and incorporates a region of increasing magnetic field as found at the Earth's pole using magnet solenoids to encase the cylindrical interaction waveguide through which an initially rectilinear electron beam (12A) was accelerated by a 75keV pulse. Experimental results showed evidence of the formation of the horseshoe distribution function. The radiation was produced in the near cut-off TE01 mode, comparable with X-mode characteristics, at 4.42GHz. Peak microwave output power was measured ∼35kW and peak efficiency of emission ∼2%, [3]. A Penning trap was constructed and inserted into the interaction waveguide to enable generation of a background plasma which would lead to closer comparisons with the magnetospheric conditions. Initial design and measurements are presented showing the principle features of the new geometry.","A","250","A & G","04/02/19","158","true","","0.576","8.0E-4","0.001","8.0E-4","2.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0867","0.0028","3.0E-4","0.0318","7.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.019","0.2729","4.0E-4","0.0022","3.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.0024","2.0E-4","0.0532","0.0083","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.5021","0.003","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0461","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0148","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0032","1.0E-4","0.0012","1.0E-4","0.288","6.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.03","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0185","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0082","0.002","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0106","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","7.0E-4"

Screening of a library of ES-62 phosphorylcholine-based small molecule analogues (SMAs) revealed that two compounds, termed 11a and 12b, mirrored the helminth product both in inhibiting mast cell degranulation and cytokine responses in vitro and in preventing ovalbumin-induced Th2-associated airway inflammation and eosin- ophil infiltration of the lungs in mice. Furthermore, the two SMAs inhibited neutrophil infiltration of the

We show that a TTF moiety appended with diphenylalanine amide derivative (TTF-FF-NH2) self-assembles into one-dimensional nanofibers that further lead to the formation of self-supporting organogels in chloroform and ethyl acetate. Upon doping of the gels with electron acceptors (TCNQ/iodine vapor), stable two-component charge transfer gels are produced in chloroform and ethyl acetate. These gels are characterized by various spectroscopy (UV-vis-NIR, FTIR and CD), microscopy (AFM and TEM), rheology and cyclic voltammetry techniques. Furthermore, conductivity measurements performed on TTF-FF-NH2 xerogel nanofiber networks formed between gold electrodes on a glass surface indicate that these nanofibers show a remarkable enhancement in the conductivity after doping with TCNQ.","C","742","D","03/08/19","96","true","","0.0047","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0015","0.0011","0.0021","0.314","0.4092","8.0E-4","0.0025","0.0071","0.0097","0.0169","0.0974","5.0E-4","0.0105","4.0E-4","0.1126","0.0086","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2193","3.0E-4","0.013","2.0E-4","0.0032","0.0016","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1962","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0754","7.0E-4","0.001","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1522","3.0E-4","0.2284","0.0137","0.0463","0.0011","1.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0049","0.0014","0.001","0.002","0.0104","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0015","7.0E-4","0.0022","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0151","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0017","4.0E-4"
"103","Rivulet flow round a horizontal cylinder subject to a uniform surface shear stress","The steady flow of a slowly varying rivulet with prescribed flux in the azimuthal direction round a large stationary horizontal cylinder subject to a prescribed uniform azimuthal surface shear stress is investigated. In particular, we focus on the case where the volume flux is downwards but the shear stress is upwards, for which there is always a solution corresponding to a rivulet flowing down at least part of one side of the cylinder. We consider both a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle but slowly varying width (i.e. de-pinned contact lines) and a rivulet with constant width but slowly varying contact angle (i.e. pinned contact lines), and show that they have qualitatively different behaviour. When shear is present, a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle can never run all the way from the top to the bottom of the cylinder, and so we consider the scenario in which an infinitely wide two-dimensional film of uniform thickness covers part of the upper half of the cylinder and ""breaks"" into a single rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle. In contrast, a sufficiently narrow rivulet with constant width can run all the way from the top to the bottom of the cylinder, whereas a wide rivulet can do so only if its contact lines de-pin, and so we consider the scenario in which the contact lines of a wide rivulet de-pin on the lower half of the cylinder.","D","659","C","22/09/16","125","true","","0.0038","0.0038","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0036","0.2048","0.0017","3.0E-4","0.0214","6.0E-4","0.2733","0.0021","0.4532","0.0016","4.0E-4","0.002","0.018","0.008","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0012","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0011","4.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1358","3.0E-4","0.0099","0.1956","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.001","5.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2677","0.0975","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0044","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.004","1.0E-4","0.0311","9.0E-4","0.0016","0.0652","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0046","3.0E-4","0.1704","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"

Hidden Markov models utilizing a Gaussian probability distribution are proposed as an anomaly detection tool for gas turbines components. The use of this technique is shown to allow the modeling of the dynamics of GTs despite a lack of high frequency data. This allows the early detection of developing faults and avoids costly outages due to asset failure. These models are implemented as part of a MAS, using a proposed extension of an established power system ontology, for fault detection of gas turbines. The multi-agent system is shown to be applicable through a case study and comparison to an existing system utilizing historic data from a combined-cycle gas turbine plant provided by an industrial partner.","E","455","B & E","01/06/19","93","true","","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0023","7.0E-4","0.0027","0.0067","3.0E-4","0.0389","7.0E-4","0.0071","0.6352","0.1446","0.019","6.0E-4","0.0215","0.1177","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.052","2.0E-4","0.0097","3.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0045","0.2217","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0719","2.0E-4","0.0011","0.0057","2.0E-4","0.0019","2.0E-4","0.5667","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0079","7.0E-4","0.0124","0.001","1.0E-4","0.0032","0.0284","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.001","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","6.0E-4"

Among them, powerful bursts of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by cusps are a promising observational signature. In this Letter we present a search for GWs from cosmic string cusps in data collected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors between 2005 and 2010, with over 625 days of live time. We find no evidence of GW signals from cosmic strings. From this result, we derive new constraints on cosmic string parameters, which complement and improve existing limits from previous searches for a stochastic background of GWs from cosmic microwave background measurements and pulsar timing data. In particular, if the size of loops is given by the gravitational backreaction scale, we place upper limits on the string tension G mu below 10-8 in some regions of the cosmic string parameter space.","B","431","E & F","25/02/17","89","true","","0.1445","0.0034","0.0022","0.0018","0.0022","0.0137","0.0014","0.0011","0.0012","0.3844","9.0E-4","0.0046","0.0581","0.3487","0.0018","0.001","3.0E-4","0.0241","0.0049","6.0E-4","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0212","5.0E-4","0.0717","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0037","0.0011","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0246","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.2358","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0017","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.153","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0059","0.0304","0.4393","1.0E-4","9.0E-4","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4"

However, there has been little work on the micro-abrasion of such materials in laboratory simulated oral environments, where abrasion, sliding wear can interact simultaneously. In this study, the effects of applied load, and exposure time were evaluated for a 316 stainless steel in a laboratory simulated artificial saliva. Polarization curves showed an enhancement of corrosion current density with increases in applied load. Wear maps were produced showing low wear safety regimes at intermediate loads and exposure times. Possible reasons for such trends are interpreted in terms of the ability of the passive film in providing resistance against third body particle impact and the concentration of particles in the contact at higher loads.","D","964","F & K","28/03/15","75","true","","0.0169","0.0063","0.0057","0.3294","0.0016","0.0048","0.0636","0.0085","6.0E-4","0.0013","0.0404","0.0331","0.0132","0.4594","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0044","8.0E-4","0.0089","0.0013","2.0E-4","0.0083","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0245","0.0024","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0179","3.0E-4","0.2912","0.019","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.3579","0.1429","0.0014","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0072","3.0E-4","7.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.037","1.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0047","8.0E-4","0.049","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0124","3.0E-4","0.0047","0.0095","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","9.0E-4","3.0E-4"

Here, immune responses induced by combinations of the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) and the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), which causes a murine hookworm infection and an experimental porin protein vaccine against STm, were examined. Mice infected with both STm and Nb induced similar numbers of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes compared with singly infected mice, as determined by flow cytometry, although lower levels of secreted Th2, but not Th1 cytokines were detected by ELISA after re-stimulation of splenocytes. Furthermore, the density of FoxP3+ T cells in the T zone of co-infected mice was lower compared to mice that only received Nb, but was greater than those that received STm. This reflected the intermediate levels of IL-10 detected from splenocytes. Co-infection compromised clearance of both pathogens, with worms still detectable in mice weeks after they were cleared in the control group. Despite altered control of bacterial and helminth colonization in co-infected mice, robust extrafollicular Th1 and Th2-reflecting immunoglobulin-switching profiles were detected, with IgG2a, IgG1 and IgE plasma cells all detected in parallel. Whilst extrafollicular antibody responses were maintained in the first weeks after co-infection, the GC response was less than that in mice infected with Nb only. Nb infection resulted in some abrogation of the longer-term development of anti-STm IgG responses. This suggested that prior Nb infection may modulate the induction of protective antibody responses to vaccination. To assess this we immunized mice with porins, which confer protection in an antibody-dependent manner, before challenging with STm. Mice that had resolved a Nb infection prior to immunization induced less anti-porin IgG and had compromised protection against infection. These findings demonstrate that co-infection can radically alter the development of protective immunity during natural infection and in response to immunization.","A","907","M & I","08/07/16","190","true","","0.0019","0.097","0.0234","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.0025","6.0E-4","0.0057","0.0099","6.0E-4","0.5084","0.0016","0.003","0.2971","0.0054","0.0018","0.0021","0.0021","0.0026","0.0343","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0489","0.002","3.0E-4","5.0E-4","1.0E-4","7.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0016","0.0033","3.0E-4","0.0011","3.0E-4","0.0788","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2679","4.0E-4","0.0026","2.0E-4","0.0031","2.0E-4","5.0E-4","0.3588","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0223","0.0027","1.0E-4","0.0012","0.0035","6.0E-4","1.0E-4","0.0039","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.1875","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0041","2.0E-4"
"108","Experimental validation of an advanced DC protection scheme for enabling an LVDC last mile distribution network","LVDC distribution systems have the potential to support future realisation of smart grids functionality. They do however present significant protection challenges that existing schemes based on DC fuses and conventional circuit breakers cannot manage due to slow device performance. Therefore, this research introduces an advanced protection scheme that addresses the outstanding challenges facing realisation of last mile DC distribution. The developed scheme has been validated using experimental testing.","E","708","B & L","27/03/15","56","true","","0.0013","0.1212","9.0E-4","0.0014","7.0E-4","0.0052","0.001","0.0065","0.0114","5.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0018","0.1105","0.3963","5.0E-4","8.0E-4","8.0E-4","9.0E-4","0.3384","4.0E-4","0.0034","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1431","0.0014","8.0E-4","3.0E-4","4.0E-4","7.0E-4","0.0029","0.0879","0.0037","0.0014","0.008","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.002","0.0409","0.0017","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.2142","0.0037","0.0021","5.0E-4","2.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.2173","0.0012","2.0E-4","0.2426","6.0E-4","0.008","2.0E-4","0.0011","2.0E-4","0.0016","3.0E-4","0.0017","2.0E-4","8.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.0011","5.0E-4"
"109","What's the use of ethical philosophy? the role of ethical theory in special educational needs","This article examines the relevance of modern moral philosophy to education, with particular reference to special educational needs. Where moral philosophers explore the tension between utilitarian and deontological reasoning, they often consider the balance between the rights of the individual and the benefits or costs for the majority. I argue that the debate is predicated on a false dichotomy between minority and majority which is best overcome by a return to virtue ethics. In exploring this ethical debate, I draw on a case study from Australia of a student excluded from mainstream education on the basis that inclusion will not serve the greater good of the majority of students. My intention here is not to offer practical guidance in the complex day-to-day deliberations of educators dealing with issues of inclusion, but to elaborate the structure of the present thinking about inclusion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the deeper basis of ethical reasoning will itself lead to a greater recognition of the need for exploring the ethical grounds of teaching and learning. I will argue that any dichotomy between the utilitarian happiness of the many and the deontological commitment to the rights of the individual is based on a misconception of human identity. The false choice between the many and the one rests upon the assumption that morality is fundamentally about restricting personal preferences in favour of the good of the majority, that there exists a fundamental conflict between what is good for the individual and what is good for society as a whole. This will lead me to argue that we need to reinterpret human identity as constituted by its social relations and that this reorientation is best achieved by reference to virtue ethics.","C","932","E & A","11/02/15","134","true","","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.1743","0.3515","7.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","4.0E-4","5.0E-4","4.0E-4","0.2573","0.2064","7.0E-4","0.002","5.0E-4","0.0012","0.0022","6.0E-4","4.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.0017","1.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","8.0E-4","0.0431","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","0.0021","0.0085","0.0051","1.0E-4","0.1956","5.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.204","1.0E-4","0.0934","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","0.3705","2.0E-4","6.0E-4","3.0E-4","3.0E-4","2.0E-4","1.0E-4","6.0E-4","2.0E-4","0.0018","2.0E-4","0.0654","1.0E-4","4.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4","2.0E-4"
