Drawing upon scaling arguments and available numerical results, a numerical method for designing well resolved, mesoscopic calculations of finite temperature superfluid turbulence is developed. The application of model and numerical method to the problem of fully developed turbulence decay in helium II, indicates that the spectral structure of normal-fluid and superfluid turbulence is significantly more complex than that of turbulence in simple-fluids. Analysis based on a forced flow of helium-4 at 1.3 K, where viscous dissipation in the normal-fluid is compensated by the Lundgren force, indicate three scaling regimes in the normal-fluid, that include the inertial, low wavenumber, Kolmogorov k?5\/3 regime, a sub-turbulence, low Reynolds number, fluctuating k?2.2 regime, and an intermediate, viscous k?6 range that connects the two. The k?2.2 regime is due to normal-fluid forcing by superfluid vortices at high wavenumbers. There are also three scaling regimes in the superfluid, that include a k?3 range that corresponds to the growth of superfluid vortex instabilities due to mutual-friction action, and an adjacent, low wavenumber, k?5\/3 regime that emerges during the termination of this growth, as superfluid vortices agglomerate between intense normal-fluid vorticity regions, and weakly polarized bundles are formed. There is also evidence of a high wavenumber k?1 range that corresponds to the probing of individual-vortex velocity fields. The Kelvin waves cascade (the main dynamical effect in zero temperature superfluids) appears to be damped at the intervortex space scale.","title":"Energy spectra of finite temperature superfluid helium-4 turbulence","authors":"H & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.2626,0.0013,3.0E-4,0.0173,3.0E-4,0.0024,0.0239,5.0E-4,0.1183,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.3078,0.026,0.2316,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0056,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"112","lemmas":"matrix electron impact excitation data mg iso electronic sequence emission line ion mg iso electronic sequence reliable diagnostic temperature density astrophysical fusion plasma wide range parameter data literature lack calculation ion sequence carry intermediate coupling frame transformation matrix calculation include total fine structure level configuration interaction target close coupling collision expansion arise configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 nl obtain ordinary collision strength maxwell average effective collision strength electron impact excitation ion mg sequence al zn18 compare result previous matrix distorted wave calculation benchmark ion find good agreement result previous calculation transition find good agreement intense transition transition important populate upper level main diagnostic line","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.5122,3.0E-4,0.0013,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0012,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0018,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.414,0.0014,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0016,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0118,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.046,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":103,"docIndex":112,"docData":{"date":"18\/02\/16","money":"102","university":"E","abstract":"Emission lines from ions in the Mg-like iso-electronic sequence can be used as reliable diagnostics of temperature and density of astrophysical and fusion plasmas over a wide range of parameters.

Therefore, it was necessary to conduct research to understand the effects of these factors, so that, the lessons learnt can be integrated into design process in order to eliminate the adverse effects of the aforementioned two factors during operation. Due to having more obvious performance outcomes ship motions and motion sickness research attracted more interest where human response to noise have been neglected so far.

(2) Construction of a plasma accelerator module with useable beam quality (3) Setup of an attosecond radiation source with advanced technology. Research and development on these topics is presently ongoing at various places at DESY, as add-on experiments at operational facilities. The two research goals are intimately connected: short bunches and precise femtosecond timing are requirements for developing a plasma accelerator module with external injection or staging. The scientific case of a dedicated facility for accelerator research at DESY is discussed. Further options are mentioned, like the use of a 1 GeV beam from Linac II for FEL studies. The presently planned conversion of the DORIS accelerator and its central halls into the SINBAD facility is described. The available space will allow setting up several independent experiments with a cost-effective use of the same infrastructure(for example a central high power laser, a central timing and synchronization lab, etc.).

Male katydids sing by rubbing their wings together to attract distant females. Their song frequencies usually range from audio (5 kHz) to low ultrasonic (30 kHz). However, males of Supersonus spp. call females at 115 kHz, 125 kHz, and 150 kHz. Exceeding the human hearing range (50 Hz\u201320 kHz) by an order of magnitude, these insects also emit their ultrasound at unusually elevated sound pressure levels (SPL). In all three species these calls exceed 110 dB SPL rms re 20 µPa (at 15 cm). Males of Supersonus spp. have unusually reduced forewings (<0.5 mm2). Only the right wing radiates appreciable sound, the left bears the file and does not show a particular resonance. In contrast to most katydids, males of Supersonus spp. position and move their wings during sound production so that the concave aspect of the right wing, underlain by the insect dorsum, forms a contained cavity with sharp resonance. The observed high SPL at extreme carrier frequencies can be explained by wing anatomy, a resonant cavity with a membrane, and cuticle deformation.","title":"Shrinking wings for ultrasonic pitch production: hyperintense ultra-short-wavelength calls in a new genus of neotropical katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae)","authors":"F & L & B"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0579,0.0429,0.1287,0.0045,0.0075,0.002,0.3223,0.0941,0.0232,8.0E-4,0.007,0.002,0.0228,0.1058,4.0E-4,0.0067,0.0048,0.0011,0.0713,0.0952]},{"docId":"13","lemmas":"fibronectin module fniii9 adsorption contrast solid model surface study atomistic molecular dynamics mechanism human fibronectin adhesion synergy region integrin binding region repeat fniii9 domain adsorption ph contrasting model surface study atomistic molecular dynamics simulation ionic model mimic mica surface charge density long range electric field surface silica model long range electric field similar find experimentally au model partial charge electric field detailed description adsorption process contrast model surface provide case model silica surface long range electrostatic field adsorption rapid primarily drive electrostatic negatively charge 1e fn iii9 readily adsorb positively charge surface due partial charge distribution fniii9 adsorb negatively charge mica model absence long range repulsive electric field protein dipole moment dictate contrasting orientation surface anchoring residue opposite charge surface adsorption model au surface specific protein region involve interaction surface strongly influence protein mobility adsorption model surface require wholesale fniii9 conformational change suggest biological activity adsorbed protein preserve","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,0.204,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0196,0.0011,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0318,0.0022,2.0E-4,0.0169,0.005,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1545,2.0E-4,0.3807,0.0019,9.0E-4,0.0012,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0304,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0056,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0446,0.0024,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0015,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0902,2.0E-4,6.0E-4],"numLemmas":148,"docIndex":13,"docData":{"date":"08\/10\/15","money":"449","university":"A","abstract":"The mechanism of human fibronectin adhesion synergy region (known as integrin binding region) in repeat 9 (FNIII9) domain adsorption at pH 7 onto various and contrasting model surfaces has been studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.

A detailed description of the adsorption processes and the contrasts between the various model surfaces is provided. In the case of our model silica surface with a long-range electrostatic field, the adsorption is rapid and primarily driven by electrostatics. Because it is negatively charged (?1e), FN III9 readily adsorbs to a positively charged surface. However, due to its partial charge distribution, FNIII9 can also adsorb to the negatively charged mica model because of the absence of a long-range repulsive electric field. The protein dipole moment dictates its contrasting orientation at these surfaces, and the anchoring residues have opposite charges to the surface. Adsorption on the model Au {111} surface is possible, but less specific, and various protein regions might be involved in the interactions with the surface. Despite strongly influencing the protein mobility, adsorption at these model surfaces does not require wholesale FNIII9 conformational changes, which suggests that the biological activity of the adsorbed protein might be preserved.","title":"Fibronectin module FNIII9 adsorption at contrasting solid model surfaces studied by atomistic molecular dynamics","authors":"E"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.2591,6.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0013,0.098,0.0045,0.0276,3.0E-4,0.1383,0.0587,0.0035,0.4032,6.0E-4,0.0019,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,3.0E-4]},{"docId":"14","lemmas":"power savings wavelength division multiplex passive optical network aircraft dense wavelength division multiplexing propose means implement communication aircraft application power consumption critical consideration impact reduce transmitter power recover loss shared amplifier investigate recover power loss shared amplifier transmitter power savings make network model savings predict realistic aircraft environment","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0011,0.2149,3.0E-4,0.1097,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.001,0.0031,2.0E-4,0.0231,0.0024,3.0E-4,0.001,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.133,9.0E-4,6.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0601,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.1614,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.121,7.0E-4,0.0365,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0012,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1185,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":48,"docIndex":14,"docData":{"date":"06\/11\/17","money":"183","university":"B","abstract":"Dense wavelength division multiplexing has been proposed as a means of implementing communications on aircraft.

These results suggest that evaluation of appropriate high-dose ICS prescribing in general practice is needed.","title":"Changes to inhaled corticosteroid dose when initiating combination inhaler therapy in long-acting β agonist-naive patients with asthma: a retrospective database analysis","authors":"L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0015,0.266,0.2314,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0345,8.0E-4,0.0019,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0128,6.0E-4,0.0336,0.1805,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.001,0.2321]},{"docId":"18","lemmas":"lymphocyte mediate neuroprotection vitro model excitotoxicity involve astrocytic activation inhibition map kinase signalling pathway establish immunosurveillance active cn play key role cn disorder exact role immune cell remain elusive present study investigate lymphocyte protective detrimental vitro model excitotoxicty kainate ka induce neuronal death significantly reduce follow exposure mixed lymphocyte purify lymphocyte activate activate lymphocyte condition media lymphocyte preparation boil condition media protective ka induce toxicity soluble mediator underlie observe neuroprotection cytokine array il candidate role astrocyte establish neuroprotection abolish presence glial toxin fluoroacetate lymphocyte inhibit p38 mapk erk signalling pathway pharmacological inhibition pathway mimic protective effect lymphocyte similarly lymphocyte neuroprotective oxygen glucose deprivation ogd induce cell death inhibition p38 mapk erk signalling pathway involve data lymphocyte neuroprotective experimental condition suggest astrocytic activation inhibition mapk signalling cascade involve study require investigate similar mechanism underlie action lymphocyte vivo experimental model disease article part special issue entitle synaptic basis neurodegenerative disorder","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0038,3.0E-4,0.0013,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0024,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1108,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.2303,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0779,3.0E-4,0.1191,0.3274,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0761,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0013,7.0E-4,0.0308,0.0013,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0059,0.002,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":148,"docIndex":18,"docData":{"date":"02\/03\/17","money":"810","university":"B","abstract":"It is well established that immunosurveillance is active in the CNS and plays a key role in several CNS disorders but the exact role of immune cells remains elusive.

Kainate (KA)-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced following exposure to mixed lymphocytes or purified T lymphocytes containing either activated or non-activated T-lymphocytes. Conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations, but not boiled conditioned media, was protective against KA-induced toxicity indicating soluble mediators underlie the observed neuroprotection with cytokine arrays indicating IL-16 as the likely candidate. A role for astrocytes was established as the neuroprotection was abolished in the presence of the glial toxin, fluoroacetate. Furthermore, lymphocytes inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways with pharmacological inhibition of these pathways mimicking the protective effect of lymphocytes. Similarly, lymphocytes were neuroprotective against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death with the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways involved. These data indicate that lymphocytes are neuroprotective under our experimental conditions and we suggest that astrocytic activation and inhibition of MAPK signalling cascades are involved but further studies are required to investigate whether similar mechanisms underlie the actions of lymphocytes in in vivo experimental models of disease.

Typically demand-driven Input-Output (IO) methods are used to quantify the impacts of such expenditures. However, IO modelling has specific weaknesses when measuring temporary tourism impacts; particular problems lie in its treatment of factor supplies and its lack of dynamics. Recent work argues that Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis is more appropriate and this has been widely applied. Neglected in this literature however is an understanding of the role that behavioural characteristics and factor supply assumptions play in determining the economic impact of tourist expenditures, particularly where expenditures are temporary (i.e. of limited duration) and anticipated (i.e. known in advance). This paper uses a CGE model for Scotland in which agents can have myopic- or forward-looking behaviours and shows how these alternative specifications affect the timing and scale of the economic impacts from anticipated and temporary tourism expenditure. The tourism shock analysed is of a scale expected for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Glasgow in 2014. The model shows how \u201Cpre-shock\u201D and \u201Clegacy\u201D effects \u2013 impacts before and after the shock \u2013 arise and their quantitative importance.

To this end we used hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles as a drug delivery system to facilitate the internalisation of Cytochrome c into cultured HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results showed that Cytochrome c can be easily conjugated to the gold shell of the nanoparticles which are readily taken up by the cells. We used Cytochrome c in concentration (0.2µgmL-1) below the threshold required to induce apoptosis on its own. When the conjugate was administered to cells treated by doxorubicin, it significantly reduced its IC50 concentration from 9µgmL-1 to 3.5µgmL-1 as detected by cell viability assay, and the efficiency of doxorubicin on decreasing viability of HepG2 cells was significantly enhanced in the lower concentration range between 0.01µgmL-1 to 5µgmL-1. The results demonstrate the potential of the application of therapeutic proteins in activating the apoptotic pathway to complement conventional chemotherapy to increase its efficacy.

As far as dose response is concerned, it is often thought that a time-independent inhibitor is reversible and a time-dependent inhibitor is irreversible. Using a simple kinetics model, we investigate the legitimacy of this. Our model-based analytical analysis and numerical studies reveal that dose response of an irreversible inhibitor may appear time-independent under certain parametric conditions. Hence, time-independence cannot be used as evidence for inhibitor reversibility. Furthermore, we also analysed how the synthesis and degradation of a target receptor affect drug inhibition in an in vitro cell-based assay setting. Indeed, these processes may also influence dose response of an irreversible inhibitor in such a way that it appears time-independent under certain conditions. Hence, time-independent dose response in a cell assay also needs careful considerations. It is necessary to formulate a suitable model for analysis of protein-based assay and in vitro cell assay data to ensure a consistent understanding.","title":"Time scale analysis of receptor enzyme activity: irreversible inhibition sometimes exhibits incubation-time independence","authors":"C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0116,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0017,0.0334,6.0E-4,0.0011,0.0086,0.0017,0.4921,0.0097,0.0125,0.4227,4.0E-4,0.001,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0013,4.0E-4]},{"docId":"3","lemmas":"coupling stochastic method detailed dynamic simulation program model calibration preliminary case study dynamic simulation program energy modelling reach high level detail accuracy represent main phenomenon determine energy performance building program subject numerous validation study demonstrate capability represent reality adequately correct input rarely case input variable unknown subject high uncertainty make prediction reality overcome issue probabilistic model order learn field data update knowledge improve physical model work propose framework apply concept show interesting promising result simple preliminary case study","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0162,3.0E-4,0.0303,8.0E-4,0.0016,2.0E-4,0.0012,0.001,4.0E-4,0.0058,0.0011,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0014,5.0E-4,0.0054,0.0014,4.0E-4,0.0017,1.0E-4,0.6405,5.0E-4,0.0018,0.0212,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,3.0E-4,0.0042,0.0287,0.1038,0.0073,2.0E-4,0.0011,0.0317,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.001,0.0011,0.0435,3.0E-4,0.0373,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0027,0.0013,7.0E-4],"numLemmas":78,"docIndex":3,"docData":{"date":"06\/06\/16","money":"778","university":"D","abstract":"Dynamic simulation programs for energy modelling have reached a high level of detail and accuracy in representing the main phenomena that determine energy performances of buildings.

In order to help facilitate these exploratory video search tasks we present a system that utilises two complementary approaches: the first a new search paradigm that allows the semantic grouping of videos and the second the exploitation of past usage history in order to provide video recommendations. We present two types of recommendation techniques adapted to the grouping search paradigm: the first is a global recommendation, which couples the multi-faceted nature of explorative video retrieval tasks with the current user need of information in order to provide recommendations, and second is a local recommendation, which exploits the organisational features of ViGOR in order to provide more localised recommendations based on a specific aspect of the user task. Two user evaluations were carried out in order to (1) validate the new search paradigm provided by ViGOR, characterised by the grouping functionalities and (2) evaluate the usefulness of the proposed recommendation approaches when integrated into ViGOR. The results of our evaluations show (1) that the grouping, organisational and recommendation functionalities can result in an improvement in the users\u2019 search performance without adversely impacting their perceptions of the system and (2) that both recommendation approaches are relevant to the users at different stages of their search, showing the importance of using multi-faceted recommendations for video retrieval systems and also illustrating the many uses of collaborative recommendations for exploratory video search tasks.","title":"Supporting exploratory video retrieval tasks with grouping and recommendation","authors":"B & E"},"mainTopicDistribution":[9.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0026,0.2899,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0016,0.0483,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0802,0.3522,2.0E-4,0.0017,0.206,3.0E-4,0.0139,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"4","lemmas":"operability assessment high speed passenger ship base human comfort criterion grow popularity passenger cruise line continual challenge face concern vessel design operational ability vessel dimension service speed performance rate rapidly increase pace expand interest essential vessel demonstrate high performance adverse sea weather condition ensure comfort passenger safety cargo vessel operability define percentage time vessel capable perform task securely order calculate vessel operability index key parameter require include dynamic response ship regular wave wave climate sea ship route assign mission vessel paper present procedure calculate operability index ship seakeeping analysis discussion sensitivity result relative employ seakeeping method give effect seasonality ship estimate operability investigate wave scatter diagram finally high speed catamaran ferry explore case study operability assess regard human comfort criterion","subTopicDistribution":[0.0038,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0068,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.073,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.2577,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0034,2.0E-4,0.0014,0.0023,2.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0015,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.5098,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0049,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1179,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0074,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0014,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":120,"docIndex":4,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"627","university":"E","abstract":"The growing popularity of passenger cruise lines means continual challenges are faced concerning both a vessel׳s design and its operational ability. Vessel dimensions, service speeds and performance rates are rapidly increasing to keep pace with this expanding interest. It is essential that vessels demonstrate high performances, even in adverse sea and weather conditions, and ensure the comfort of passengers and the safety of cargo. A vessel׳s operability can be defined as the percentage of time in which the vessel is capable of performing her tasks securely. In order to calculate a vessel׳s operability index, many key parameters are required. These include the dynamic responses of the ship to regular waves, the wave climate of the sea around the ship׳s route, and the assigned missions of the vessel. This paper presents a procedure to calculate the operability index of a ship using seakeeping analyses. A discussion of the sensitivity of the results relative to three different employed seakeeping methods is then given. The effect of seasonality on a ship׳s estimated operability is also investigated using wave scatter diagrams.

Main outcome measures PA over 7\u2005days was measured objectively by an accelerometer; three categories of PA were created: \u2018active\u2019 ≥60\u2005min\/day moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA); \u2018moderately active\u2019 30\u201359\u2005min\/day MVPA; \u2018inactive\u2019 <30\u2005min\/day MVPA. Dietary intake over 4\u2005days was measured using a prospective dietary assessment tool which incorporated elements of the food diary and food frequency methods. Three diet categories were created: \u2018healthy\u2019, \u2018unhealthy\u2019 and \u2018mixed\u2019, according to the number of portions of different foods consumed. Adherence to the \u20185-a-day\u2019 recommendations for portions of fruit and vegetables was also assessed. Children were classified as \u2018healthy weight\u2019 or \u2018overweight or obese\u2019 (OW\/OB) according to International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints for BMI. Associations between weight status and PA\/diet categories were analysed using logistic regression.  Few children met the UK-recommended guidelines for either MVPA or fruit and vegetable intake, with just 7% meeting the recommended amount of MVPA of 60\u2005min\/day, and 3% meeting the 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation. Higher PA was associated with a lower OR for OW\/OB in boys only (0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88). There was no association detected between dietary intake and OW\/OB in either sex.  Increasing MVPA may help to reduce OW\/OB in boys; however, more research is required to examine this relationship in girls.

Methods Peer problems were investigated over a 9-year period (from 7 to 16 years of age) in 171 children with a history of SLI. Discrete factor growth modelling was used to chart developmental trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors associated with group membership. Results Four distinct developmental trajectories were identified: low-level\/no problems in peer relations (22.2% of participants), childhood-limited problems (12.3%), childhood-onset persistent problems (39.2%) and adolescent-onset problems (26.3%). Risk of poor trajectories of peer relations was greater for those children with pragmatic language difficulties. Prosocial behaviour was the factor most strongly associated with trajectory group membership. Overall, the more prosocial children with better pragmatic language skills and lower levels of emotional problems had less difficulty in developing peer relations. Conclusions Analysis of developmental trajectories enriches our understanding of social development. A sizeable minority in the present sample sustained positive relations through childhood and adolescence, and others overcame early difficulties to achieve low levels of problems by their early teens; the majority, however, showed childhood-onset persistent or adolescent-onset problems.","title":"Longitudinal trajectories of peer relations in children with specific language impairment","authors":"E & F & G"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.2426,0.0067,0.0051,0.2189,8.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0052,0.0079,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.078,0.2866,3.0E-4,0.1063,0.0381,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,9.0E-4]},{"docId":"22","lemmas":"radical student engagement paper argue term student engagement uk higher education cover activity distinct set benefit pedagogical political overarching account student engagement unify set benefit concept student engagement uk fundamentally fracture paper propose critical pedagogy provide underpin account expense current mainstream nature student engagement paper argue work student engagement uk higher education face dilemma sacrifice idea student engagement popular solution mainstream challenge give idea student engagement unify set benefit coherent purpose","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0026,2.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0028,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0019,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1361,0.001,0.0076,0.4027,2.0E-4,0.0358,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0044,0.0038,0.3769,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0012,0.0074,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0047,3.0E-4,0.0013],"numLemmas":71,"docIndex":22,"docData":{"date":"27\/12\/19","money":"266","university":"C","abstract":"This paper argues that the term \u2018student engagement\u2019 as used in UK higher\neducation covers activities with two distinct sets of benefits: those that are\npedagogical, and those that are political.

Goal: This paper aims to investigate how users report bugs in systems: what information is provided, how frequently, and the consequences of this. Method: The study examined the quality and quantity of information provided in 1600 bugs reports drawn from four open-source projects (Eclipse, Firefox, Apache HTTP, and Facebook API), recorded what information users actually provide, how and when users provide the information, and how this affects the outcome of the bug. Results: Of the recorded sources of information, only observed behaviour and expected results appeared in more than 50% of reports. Those sources deemed highly useful by developers and tools such as stack traces and test cases appeared very infrequently. However, no strong relationship was observed between the provided information and the outcome of the bug. Conclusions: The paper demonstrates a clear mismatch between the information that developers would wish to appear in a bug report, and the information that actually appears.

The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon's surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system.  Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing\/take-off pathways to and from Phobos' surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.","title":"Dynamical systems techniques for designing libration point orbits in proximity of highly-inhomogeneous planetary satellites: Application to the Mars-Phobos elliptic three-body problem with additional gravity harmonics","authors":"H & J"},"mainTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.5528,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0013,0.4412,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"130","lemmas":"customer creation work mediate role customer determination role stress article examine mechanism customer creation role behavior customer creation extra role behavior influence customer result survey business customer supplier dyad show customer creation role behavior customer creation extra role behavior influence customer process customer determination customer role stress lead increase customer turn customer result show relationship quality interpersonal attraction moderate influence customer creation behavior customer determination customer role stress","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0071,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0028,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.2327,6.0E-4,0.0018,0.0024,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.001,0.016,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.3066,3.0E-4,0.0012,0.0014,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0053,0.0012,0.4112],"numLemmas":68,"docIndex":130,"docData":{"date":"19\/01\/17","money":"495","university":"B","abstract":"This article examines the mechanisms by which customer value creation in-role behavior and customer value creation extra-role behavior influence customer well-being.

Searches focussed on studies published between the start of 2000 and the end of June 2013. Abstracts of reviews of public health interventions were examined with respect to target groups, health topic, intervention characteristics, media used, study design, issues of quality and ethics, and outcomes. To map this area of work fully, this information was supplemented by adding information from primary studies. Areas were identified where systematic review evidence was scarce or non-existent by comparing the final map with information from the reviews analysed.\n\nResults - 221 systematic reviews related to digital media use in a public health context were included. Most reviews included studies with an experimental design and general \u2018at risk\u2019 target populations. Specific settings were not specified in the majority of reviews. A large variety of health topics were covered. About a quarter of reviews did not specify a health topic but were concerned with broader issues of health promotion, disease prevention, or health education. Over half of the reviews focussed on eHealth and telemedicine, and another third were concerned with mass media \u2013 social marketing. Reviews most frequently reported behaviour-related outcomes or conducted some form of content analysis or analysis of the use of particular media. Research gaps were identified relating to community-based research, participation and empowerment, active media use (especially with respect to visual media und use of specific visual methodologies), and the use of salutogenic or assets-based approaches.\n\nConclusion - The available research relating to digital media use in public health is dominated by studies relating to eHealth, telehealth or social marketing; emphasising the passive reception of messages and a focus on individual behaviour change approaches. Issues of quality and ethics need to be taken into account more consistently. Further research is needed with respect to more participatory methods, particularly those which would seek to use digital media as a means to harness individual and community assets.","title":"Just telling and selling: current limitations in the use of digital media in public health: A scoping review","authors":"E & F"},"mainTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0032,0.0015,6.0E-4,0.5289,0.0013,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0015,0.1889,0.2039,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0616,3.0E-4,0.0055,1.0E-4]},{"docId":"136","lemmas":"embed research practice innovation creativity case study social service paper explore iriss institute research innovation social service promote delivery cost effective social service scotland support achievement positive outcome approach evidence inform practice characterise pillar activity focus improve awareness access evidence refer strengthen evidence base discuss context work direct support improve skill confidence evidence form pillar final pillar embed evidence organisation coproduction create space test challenge evidence development evidence base product","subTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,0.003,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0022,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1633,0.0014,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0162,0.1595,6.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.002,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0023,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.5867,3.0E-4,0.0298,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,9.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0143,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0047],"numLemmas":70,"docIndex":136,"docData":{"date":"30\/12\/17","money":"139","university":"B","abstract":"This paper explores ways in which IRISS (Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services) promotes the delivery of cost effective social services in Scotland that support the achievement of positive outcomes.

Current UK energy policy focuses on the need for a clean, affordable and secure energy supply. Decentralisation of the electricity system is recognised as one means of achieving efficient and renewable energy provision, as well as addressing concerns over ageing electricity infrastructure and capacity constraints.    In this paper we provide a critical literature review of the economics of increased penetration of distributed energy generation.  We find that there exists a large volume of research considering the financial viability of individual distributed generation technologies (and we are necessarily selective in our review of these studies, given the wide variety of technologies that the definition of distributed generation encompasses).  However, there are few studies that focus on the pure economics of individual or groups of distributed energy generators, and even fewer still based on the economy-wide aspects of distributed generation.  In view of this gap in the literature, we provide suggestions for future research which are likely to be necessary in order adequately to inform public policy on distributed generation and its role in the future of UK energy supply.","title":"The economics of distributed energy generation: a literature review","authors":"E & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,6.0E-4,9.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0012,0.0069,0.0015,0.0015,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.001,0.4045,0.1556,7.0E-4,9.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.4218,9.0E-4]},{"docId":"30","lemmas":"protective coating superplastic form ceramic die opportunity thermal spray technology null","subTopicDistribution":[0.001,0.0015,0.001,0.0051,6.0E-4,0.003,0.0013,0.0014,6.0E-4,0.0022,8.0E-4,0.6866,0.0124,0.0021,5.0E-4,0.0013,0.0011,9.0E-4,0.0029,0.0014,5.0E-4,0.0012,0.001,0.0436,0.0057,0.003,0.0016,6.0E-4,0.0014,0.0024,0.0016,0.0011,0.0011,0.143,6.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0022,0.0021,6.0E-4,0.0015,0.0018,9.0E-4,0.001,9.0E-4,0.0469,7.0E-4,0.0011,0.0012,9.0E-4,0.0033],"numLemmas":11,"docIndex":30,"docData":{"date":"23\/12\/19","money":"360","university":"C","abstract":"null","title":"Protective coatings for superplastic forming ceramic dies: opportunities for thermal spray technology","authors":"L & K & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0036,0.0015,0.0018,0.7785,0.0021,0.0278,0.0045,0.0036,0.0022,0.0047,0.0359,0.0053,0.0613,0.0506,0.0021,0.0047,0.0014,0.0029,0.0053,0.0013]},{"docId":"31","lemmas":"quantum cascade laser base mid infrared spectrochemical imaging tissue biofluid mid infrared spectroscopic imaging rapidly emerge technique biomedical research clinical diagnostic advantage unique molecular fingerprint cell tissue biofluid provide rich biochemical image stain spectroscopic analysis objective classification biological material molecular level label free molecular imaging technique apply histology cytology surgical pathology microbiology stem cell research detect subtle change genome proteome metabolome wealth biochemical information make technique distinct potential improve cancer patient outcome identification earlier stage disease drug resistance disease state high risk population maturity science instrumentation provide increase sample throughput improve image quality small footprint low maintenance require minimal spectral expertise essential clinical translation","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.2176,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0026,0.1236,7.0E-4,6.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.002,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0036,0.0068,0.0012,7.0E-4,0.0042,3.0E-4,0.0026,0.0534,0.264,5.0E-4,0.0226,4.0E-4,0.0029,3.0E-4,0.009,0.0118,0.0109,0.0019,0.0194,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.075,0.0997,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0393,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0167,5.0E-4],"numLemmas":104,"docIndex":31,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/18","money":"482","university":"D","abstract":"Mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging is a rapidly emerging technique in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics that takes advantage of the unique molecular fingerprint of cells, tissue and biofluids to provide a rich biochemical image without the need for staining.

This algorithm combines the advantages of a pure branch-and-bound approach and cutting planes scheme. Branch-and-cut algorithm computes the linear programming relaxation of the problem at each node of the search tree which is improved by the use of cuts, i.e. by the inclusion of valid inequalities. It should be taken into account that selection of strongest cuts is crucial for their effective use in branch-and-cut algorithm.\n\nIn this thesis, we focus on the derivation and use of cutting planes to solve general mixed integer problems, and in particular inventory problems combined with other problems such as distribution, supplier selection, vehicle routing, etc. In order to achieve this goal, we first consider substructures (relaxations) of such problems which are obtained by the coherent loss of information. The polyhedral structure of those simpler mixed integer sets is studied to derive strong valid inequalities. Finally those strong inequalities are included in the cutting plane algorithms to solve the general mixed integer problems.\n\nWe study three mixed integer sets in this dissertation. The first two mixed integer sets arise as a subproblem of the lot-sizing with supplier selection, the network design and the vendor-managed inventory routing problems. These sets are variants of the  well-known single node fixed-charge network set where a binary or integer variable is associated with the node. The third set occurs as a subproblem of mixed integer sets where incompatibility between binary variables is considered. We generate families of valid inequalities for those sets, identify classes of facet-defining inequalities, and discuss the separation problems associated with the inequalities. Then cutting plane frameworks are implemented to solve some mixed integer programs. Preliminary computational experiments are presented in this direction.","title":"Polyhedral Study of Mixed Integer Sets Arising from Inventory Problems","authors":"A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0376,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0305,0.0306,0.001,0.0198,0.0094,3.0E-4,0.0016,0.0175,0.3748,3.0E-4,0.3888,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0859,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"35","lemmas":"influence scale effect hub load horizontal wind turbine wind industry aim generate energy reduce energy cost increase energy capacity machine result load scale linearly nowadays lack study variation load specially fatigue due scaling wind turbine paper aim generate general fatigue load trend wind turbine public accuracy controller wind turbine model investigate check blade root bend moment subsequently fatigue load calculate base bend moment blade root wind turbine model obtain result demonstrate possibility generate general load trend model additionally blade root load divide deterministic stochastic part part investigate effect fatigue load sensitivity study perform identify influence wind turbulence fatigue load increase reference turbulence intensity","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0019,1.0E-4,0.0063,2.0E-4,0.2221,1.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0031,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.2978,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.3929,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.001,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0253,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0376,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0015,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":103,"docIndex":35,"docData":{"date":"19\/11\/18","money":"906","university":"A","abstract":"Wind industry aims to generate more energy and reduce energy cost by increasing energy capacity of machines.

In addition, acoustic measures of cepstral peak prominence (CPP), smoothed CPP (CPPs), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), shimmer %, shimmer dB, amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), relative average perturbation (RAP), jitter, and pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ) were performed. Statistical analysis involved correlations between perceptual and acoustic measures, as well as determination of differences across speaker groups and elicitation tasks.

However, the \u2018between-population\u2019 component of genetic diversity (biocomplexity) is threatened in many exploited populations, particularly marine fish, where harvest management regions may be larger than the spatial extent of genetically distinct sub-populations. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data we delineated the geographic limits of three population units of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in northwest European waters. Two of the populations co-habit the North Sea, and trawl survey data showed differing trends in their abundances. We developed a spatial model of these units to simulate population dynamics under spatial patterns of harvesting, Competition between units during the pelagic juvenile stages in the model led to suppression of the more localised northern North Sea (Viking) unit by the more widespread (Dogger) unit, and its premature extinction under some spatial patterns of fishing. Fishery catch limits for cod are set at the scale of the whole North Sea without regard to such sub-population dynamics. Our model offers a method to quantify adjustments to regional fishing mortality rates to strike a balance between maximising sustainable yield and conserving vulnerable populations.","title":"Combination of genetics and spatial modelling highlights the sensitivity of cod (Gadus morhua) population diversity in the North Sea to distributions of fishing","authors":"L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,0.208,0.0012,0.1997,8.0E-4,0.0038,7.0E-4,0.0116,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0775,6.0E-4,0.0633,0.3619,0.0011,0.0666,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0013,0.0011]},{"docId":"38","lemmas":"identify prognostic indicator electrical treeing solid insulation pulse sequence analysis predictive maintenance attempt evaluate condition equipment predict future trend equipment aging order reduce cost compare traditional approach corrective preventive maintenance prediction require accurate prognostic model aging solid insulation ultimate goal prognostic predict advent failure insulation breakdown term remain life rul fault electrical tree progressive lead potentially catastrophic failure research show diagnosis fault achieve base partial discharge pd monitoring phase resolve pulse sequence analysis psa work explore extension concept predict evolution defect move diagnostic prognostic investigation prognostic feature pd characteristic lead breakdown work needle plane test arrangement set hypodermic needle pre form silicone rubber test sample visual observation tree growth measurement make digital microscope pd data capture radio frequency rf sensor analyse psa main idea psa approach strong relationship consecutive pulse pd activity give understanding local degradation process electrical tree breakdown indicator psa appearance heavily cluster data point lie diagonally scatter plot differential ratio voltage time consecutive charge tn figure show plot change diagonal line hour age time paper investigate formation diagonal line base distribution plot start electrical tree breakdown occur finally statistical feature psa plot give lifetime prediction insulation sample future work","subTopicDistribution":[0.0013,0.0052,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0282,2.0E-4,0.0926,0.0131,0.0019,0.0014,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0266,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.3898,8.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0066,5.0E-4,0.0094,0.0011,0.0733,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0055,0.0012,0.3041,1.0E-4,0.0064,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0132,1.0E-4,0.0013,0.0104,2.0E-4,7.0E-4],"numLemmas":192,"docIndex":38,"docData":{"date":"25\/01\/19","money":"290","university":"B","abstract":"Predictive maintenance attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment and predict the future trend of the equipment's aging, in order to reduce costs when compared to the two traditional approaches: corrective and preventive maintenance. This prediction requires an accurate prognostic model of aging. In solid insulation, the ultimate goal of prognostics is to predict the advent of failure, i.e., insulation breakdown, in terms of remaining useful life (RUL). One fault is electrical treeing, which is progressive thus leading to potentially catastrophic failure. Research has shown that diagnosis of faults can be achieved based on partial discharge (PD) monitoring [1], i.e., phase-resolved and pulse sequence analysis (PSA). This work will explore the extension of this concept towards predicting evolution of the defect: moving beyond diagnostics towards prognostics. To do this, there is a need for further investigation of prognostic features within PD characteristics leading up to breakdown. In this work, a needle-plane test arrangement was set up using a hypodermic needle and pre-formed silicone rubber as test samples. The visual observations and tree growth measurements were made using a digital microscope. PD data was captured using a radio frequency (RF) sensor and analysed using PSA. The main idea of the PSA approach is the strong relationship between two consecutive pulses caused by PD activities, which can give an understanding of the local degradation processes [1]. As for electrical treeing, a breakdown indicator in PSA is the appearance of heavily clustered data points that lie diagonally in scatter plots of the differential ratio of voltage and time of consecutive charges (Un = Δun\/Δtn) [2,3]. Figure 1 shows an example of a plot that changed to a diagonal line after 14 hours of aging time. This paper investigates the formation of the diagonal line based on the distribution of the plot from the start of electrical treeing until breakdown occurs. Finally, statistical features of the PSA plot are given and will be used for lifetime prediction of insulation samples in future work.","title":"Identifying prognostic indicators for electrical treeing in solid insulation through pulse sequence analysis","authors":"B & H"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0351,4.0E-4,0.0309,0.0059,0.0034,0.0048,0.0319,6.0E-4,0.0047,2.0E-4,8.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0207,0.4577,5.0E-4,0.3011,0.0224,0.0033,0.076,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"39","lemmas":"method result search gravitational wave associate gamma ray burst geo ligo virgo detector paper report search short duration gravitational wave burst frequency range hz hz associate gamma ray burst grb data geo ligo virgo detector introduce method linear search grid analyze grb event large sky localization uncertainty localization provide fermi gamma ray burst monitor gbm coherent search gravitational wave gw computationally intensive grb sky position localized due correction require difference arrival time detector linear search grid reduce computational cost analysis factor gbm event demonstrate analysis pipeline improve sky localization grb detect gbm high frequency gw signal observe coincidence method linear grid search gw associate grb observe satellite base gamma ray experiment grb sample previously analyze gw counterpart fraction grb event analyze data geo detector squeeze light state improve sensitivity search gw data squeeze light interferometric observatory find evidence gw signal individual grb sample population grb place lower bound distance progenitor assumption fix gw emission energy circle dot median exclusion distance mpc emission hz mpc khz reduce computational cost associate linear search grid enable rapid search gw associate fermi gbm event advanced ligo virgo detector begin operation","subTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0186,1.0E-4,0.0633,0.0286,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0016,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0248,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.3426,9.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.017,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0221,0.0099,1.0E-4,0.0098,0.0634,0.3789,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0039,0.0081,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":186,"docIndex":39,"docData":{"date":"09\/02\/18","money":"819","university":"C","abstract":"In this paper we report on a search for short-duration gravitational wave bursts in the frequency range 64 Hz-1792 Hz associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), using data from GEO 600 and one of the LIGO or Virgo detectors. We introduce the method of a linear search grid to analyze GRB events with large sky localization uncertainties, for example the localizations provided by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs) can be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not well localized, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival time between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky localization of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is observed in coincidence. We use the method of the linear grid in a search for GWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments between 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analyzed for GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analyzed using data from GEO 600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its sensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light interferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each GRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under an assumption of a fixed GW emission energy of 10(-2)M circle dot c(2), with a median exclusion distance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced computational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid searches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events once the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors begin operation.","title":"Methods and results of a search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts using the GEO 600, LIGO, and Virgo detectors","authors":"D & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0871,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0012,0.0596,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.2674,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0053,0.4292,0.002,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0859,0.0587,3.0E-4]},{"docId":"140","lemmas":"th1 immune response modulate vary dimethyldioctadecylammonium distearoyl sn glycero phosphocholine content liposomal adjuvant objective cationic liposome dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide dda combine trehalose dibehenate tdb elicit strong cell mediate antibody immune response dda facilitate antigen adsorption presentation tdb potentiate immune response investigate role dda dda replace neutral lipid distearoyl sn glycero phosphocholine dspc series concentration system investigate adjuvant delivery ag85b esat rv2660c multistage tuberculosis vaccine method liposomal prepare dda tdb weight ratio dda content incrementally replace dspc physicochemical characteristic assess vesicle size zeta potential antigen loading ability system act adjuvant key finding dda replace dspc liposomal formulation cationic nature vesicle decrease electrostatically binding anionic h56 antigen hybrid56 ag85b esat6 rv2660c dda complete replace dspc vesicle size increase significantly helper th1 type cell mediated immune response reduce reduction response attribute replacement dda dspc reduction dda dose concentration formulation conclusion result suggest th1 response control tailor dda dspc ratio liposomal adjuvant system","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,0.0825,2.0E-4,0.0013,0.0011,9.0E-4,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0073,0.0303,4.0E-4,0.0018,4.0E-4,0.0092,2.0E-4,0.0027,0.0491,7.0E-4,0.0023,0.0784,4.0E-4,0.0058,0.3192,0.0253,0.0056,0.0072,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0086,0.2523,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0066,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0703,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0241,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4],"numLemmas":148,"docIndex":140,"docData":{"date":"22\/04\/19","money":"405","university":"A","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Cationic liposomes of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) combined with trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (TDB) elicit strong cell-mediated and antibody immune responses; DDA facilitates antigen adsorption and presentation while TDB potentiates the immune response. To further investigate the role of DDA, DDA was replaced with the neutral lipid of distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) over a series of concentrations and these systems investigated as adjuvants for the delivery of Ag85B-ESAT-6-Rv2660c, a multistage tuberculosis vaccine.METHODS: Liposomal were prepared at a 5 : 1 DDA-TDB weight ratio and DDA content incrementally replaced with DSPC. The physicochemical characteristics were assessed (vesicle size, zeta potential and antigen loading), and the ability of these systems to act as adjuvants was considered.KEY FINDINGS: As DDA was replaced with DSPC within the liposomal formulation, the cationic nature of the vesicles decreases as does electrostatically binding of the anionic H56 antigen (Hybrid56; Ag85B-ESAT6-Rv2660c); however, only when DDA was completed replaced with DSPC did vesicle size increase significantly. T-helper 1 (Th1)-type cell-mediated immune responses reduced. This reduction in responses was attributed to the replacement of DDA with DSPC rather than the reduction in DDA dose concentration within the formulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest Th1 responses can be controlled by tailoring the DDA\/DSPC ratio within the liposomal adjuvant system.","title":"Th1 immune responses can be modulated by varying dimethyldioctadecylammonium and distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine content in liposomal adjuvants","authors":"A & G"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0171,0.0117,0.0014,0.0076,3.0E-4,0.0066,0.001,0.0101,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.4815,0.0119,0.02,0.4051,4.0E-4,0.0192,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0023,0.0027]},{"docId":"141","lemmas":"conformation effective interaction polymer coated nanoparticle liquid interface investigate conformation effective interaction polymer coated nanopar ticle adsorb model liquid liquid interface molecular dynamics simulation polymer shell strongly deform interface shape govern balance maximise decrease interfacial area solvent component minimise unfavourable contact polymer solvent max imise conformational entropy polymer potential force calculation compute effective interaction nanoparticle liquid liquid interface find differ quantitatively bulk sig nificantly affect length polymer chain solvent quality good solvent condition effective interaction repulsive soft long chain repulsion range decrease solvent quality decrease poor solvent condition short chain fail induce steric repul sion lead net attraction nanoparticle long chain effective interaction potential feature additional repulsive shoulder intermediate distance","subTopicDistribution":[6.0E-4,0.2544,0.0046,4.0E-4,0.0021,9.0E-4,0.0058,0.0031,2.0E-4,0.0081,2.0E-4,0.0109,0.0021,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0185,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0019,0.1559,1.0E-4,0.3173,0.0049,0.1195,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.0246,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0058,0.0132,0.0058,0.0014,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0016,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.004,8.0E-4,0.0241,0.0015],"numLemmas":110,"docIndex":141,"docData":{"date":"09\/10\/15","money":"932","university":"D","abstract":"We investigate conformations and effective interactions of polymer-coated nanopar- ticles adsorbed at a model liquid-liquid interface via molecular dynamics simulations.

We find that it differs quantitatively from the bulk and is sig- nificantly affected by the length of the polymer chains and by the solvent quality.

In particular, under poor solvent conditions, short chains may fail to induce steric repul- sion, leading to a net attraction between the nanoparticles, whereas with long enough chains the effective interaction potential may feature an additional repulsive shoulder at intermediate distances.","title":"Conformations and effective interactions of polymer coated nanoparticles at liquid interfaces","authors":"H & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0011,3.0E-4,0.0015,0.0017,5.0E-4,0.0011,0.1426,0.1989,0.0431,0.0019,0.1168,0.1035,0.0068,0.3625,0.0058,0.0089,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0018]},{"docId":"142","lemmas":"laser pulse propagation enhance energy coupling fast electron dense plasma gradient laser energy absorption fast electron interaction ultra intense cm2 picosecond laser pulse solid investigate experimentally numerically function plasma density scale length irradiated surface show optimum density gradient efficient energy coupling electron arise due strong focus channel drive energy absorption extended length preformed plasma longer density gradient laser lament result significantly lower energy coupling scale length increase transition laser energy absorption process observe experimentally multiple diagnostic result demonstrate significantly enhance laser energy absorption coupling fast electron dynamically control plasma density gradient","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.6709,0.0224,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0111,0.0013,2.0E-4,0.0041,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0035,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.2436,0.0311,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0034,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":91,"docIndex":142,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/19","money":"599","university":"B","abstract":"Laser energy absorption to fast electrons during the interaction of an ultra-intense (1020 W\/cm2), picosecond laser pulse with a solid is investigated, experimentally and numerically, as a function of the plasma density scale length at the irradiated surface.

This workshop brings together researchers who are re-imagining common mobile interfaces so that they are more suited to use by older adults.","title":"Re-imagining commonly used mobile interfaces for older adults","authors":"E & F"},"mainTopicDistribution":[6.0E-4,0.0013,0.001,0.0058,6.0E-4,0.3292,0.0016,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0027,0.0017,0.1962,0.1754,0.001,5.0E-4,0.2757,6.0E-4,0.005,5.0E-4]},{"docId":"146","lemmas":"effect incorporate cholesterol dda tdb liposomal adjuvant bilayer property biodistribution immune response cholesterol abundant component mammalian cell membrane extensively study artificial membrane stabilizer wide range phospholipid liposome system study aim investigate role cholesterol cationic liposomal adjuvant system base dimethyldioctadecylammonium dda trehalose dibehenate tdb show strong adjuvant system vaccine wide range disease packaging cholesterol dda tdb liposome investigate differential scanning calorimetery surface pressure area isotherm lipid monolayer incorporation cholesterol liposomal membrane promote formation liquid condensed monolayer remove main phase transition temperature system result increase bilayer fluidity reduce antigen retention vitro vivo biodistribution study find increase membrane fluidity alter deposition liposome antigen site injection term immune response early day immunization igg response reduce inclusion cholesterol difference antibody igg igg1 igg2b response promote dda tdb liposome cholesterol significantly higher level ifn gamma induce dda tdb liposome liposome uptake macrophage vitro show higher dda tdb liposome compare cholesterol counterpart suggest small change bilayer mechanic impact cellular interaction immune response","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.0366,3.0E-4,0.0093,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.018,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0044,6.0E-4,0.0635,3.0E-4,0.0021,0.0206,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.3125,0.066,0.0048,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0092,0.2331,0.0098,2.0E-4,0.0051,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.1516,1.0E-4,0.0015,0.0414,0.0016,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0014,2.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":155,"docIndex":146,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/18","money":"140","university":"B","abstract":"Cholesterol is an abundant component of mammalian cell membranes and has been extensively studied as an artificial membrane stabilizer in a wide range of phospholipid liposome systems.

Packaging of cholesterol within DDA:TDB liposomes was investigated using differential scanning calorimetery and surface pressure-area isotherms of lipid monolayers; incorporation of cholesterol into liposomal membranes promoted the formation of a liquid-condensed monolayer and removed the main phase transition temperature of the system, resulting in an increased bilayer fluidity and reduced antigen retention in vitro. In vivo biodistribution studies found that this increase in membrane fluidity did not alter deposition of liposomes and antigen at the site of injection. In terms of immune responses, early (12 days after immunization) IgG responses were reduced by inclusion of cholesterol; thereafter there were no differences in antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2b) responses promoted by DDA:TDB liposomes with and without cholesterol. However, significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma were induced by DDA:TDB liposomes, and liposome uptake by macrophages in vitro was also shown to be higher for DDA:TDB liposomes compared to their cholesterol-containing counterparts, suggesting that small changes in bilayer mechanics can impact both cellular interactions and immune responses.","title":"Effect of incorporating cholesterol into DDA:TDB liposomal adjuvants on bilayer properties, biodistribution, and immune responses","authors":"F & K"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.002,0.0442,0.1703,0.0037,6.0E-4,0.0014,0.0157,0.1065,0.0034,8.0E-4,0.3415,0.0016,0.0026,0.2988,0.001,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0013,0.0031,0.0017]},{"docId":"147","lemmas":"development readability index attuned english study japan year engage evaluate technique estimate readability arise work iteration readability index attuned english textbook employ japanese high school english study paper briefly review approach readability measurement detail project aim develop readability index attuned english teaching system japan earlier approach japanese english teaching context employ regression analysis develop linear measure sentence length word length word difficulty idiom difficulty independent variable textbook year passage dependent variable linear function diff prove broadly effective guide read level english text japanese school context release ozasa fukui year level change english study japan make update english readability index end earlier approach enhance provide linear formula expert readability judgement english sentence employ dependent variable combine previously develop linear function diff independent variable resultant computation yield linear function expression newdiff exp diff follow component diff word syllable worddiff idiomdiff apply measure determine coefficient determination formula high degree fit target data","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,0.0274,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0334,9.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,0.0133,0.0018,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.4686,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1826,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0153,0.0548,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0279,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0183,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1472,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":149,"docIndex":147,"docData":{"date":"13\/11\/16","money":"259","university":"C","abstract":"For several years, we have been engaged in evaluating techniques for estimating readability. Arising from this work, there have been several iterations of readability indices attuned to the English textbooks employed in Japanese high schools for the English Course of Study. In this paper, we briefly review approaches to readability measurement before detailing our project that aims to develop new readability indices that are attuned to the new English teaching system of Japan. Our earlier approach to the Japanese English teaching context employed regression analysis to develop a linear measure in which sentence length, word length, word difficulty and idiom difficulty are independent  variables and the textbook year of passages is a dependent variable. This linear function (Diff) proved to be broadly effective as a guide to reading level for English texts in the Japanese school context and was released for use as 'the Ozasa-Fukui Year Level'. From 2012, changes to the English Course of Study in Japan made it necessary to update this English readability index. To this end, our earlier approach was enhanced to provide a non-linear formula in which an experts\u2019 readability judgement of English sentences is employed as a dependent variable and combined with the previously developed linear function (Diff) as an independent variable. The resultant computation yielded a non-linear function expression: NewDiff = a\/(1+b*exp(-c*Diff))+0.9 in which we have the following component values:\na=3.8593, b=766.9372, c=2.5709, Diff = 0.0863*Words\/S + 0.2943*Syllables\/W + 0.6332*WordDiff\/W + 0.0665*IdiomDiff\/S + 0.5366. Applying this new measure, we determined that the coefficient of determination for this new formula (r^2) was 0.8236. Thereby, indicating a high degree of fit to the target data.","title":"Development of a readability index attuned to the new English Course of Study in Japan","authors":"M & I"},"mainTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.2176,0.0014,6.0E-4,0.0788,0.0013,3.0E-4,0.0018,3.0E-4,0.0082,0.0045,0.0339,0.5318,5.0E-4,0.1166,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.001,6.0E-4]},{"docId":"148","lemmas":"protocol storage limitation upgrade decentralised network maidsafe distribute network user store mutable immutable data remain accessible network distribute hash table essentially forever raise obvious question restrict malicious party make excessive network resource order ensure storage capacity network quickly deplete small number user make excessive storage activity risk prevent legitimate network paper explore means secure storage quota management decentralised network present concept manager verification present protocol base solution user purchase extra storage user decentralised network irrepudiable forgeable agreement verifiable party","subTopicDistribution":[0.0334,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.3809,0.001,8.0E-4,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0066,0.0013,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0056,9.0E-4,0.0012,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1972,4.0E-4,0.001,8.0E-4,0.0047,0.0097,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0034,0.1592,5.0E-4,0.0257,0.0017,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1514,8.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0018,0.0019,8.0E-4],"numLemmas":79,"docIndex":148,"docData":{"date":"26\/07\/19","money":"383","university":"E","abstract":"Within the MaidSafe distributed network, users are able to store mutable and immutable data, which will remain accessible on the network in a distributed hash table, essentially forever.

The protective effect of drug encapsulation by CB[7] was also examined on the platinum-based anticancer drug cisplatin. The results show that none of the cucurbiturils have statistically measurable neurotoxicity as measured using mouse sciatic nerve compound action potential. Cucurbituril myotoxicity was measured by nerve-muscle force of contraction through chemical and electrical stimulation. Motor2 was found to display no myotoxicity, whereas both CB[6] and CB[7] showed myotoxic activity via a presynaptic effect. Finally, cardiotoxicity, which was measured by changes in the rate and force of right and left atria contraction, was observed for all three cucurbiturils. Free cisplatin displays neuro-, myo- and cardiotoxic activity, consistent with the side-effects seen in the clinic. Whilst CB[7] had no effect on the level of cisplatin's neurotoxic activity, drug encapsulation within the macrocycle had a marked reduction in both the drug's myo- and cardiotoxic activity. Overall the results are consistent with the relative lack of toxicity displayed by these macrocycles in whole animal acute systemic toxicity studies and indicate continued potential of cucurbiturils as drug delivery vehicles for the reduction of the side effects associated with platinum-based chemotherapy.","title":"The ex vivo neurotoxic, myotoxic and cardiotoxic activity of cucurbituril-based macrocyclic drug delivery vehicles","authors":"E & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[9.0E-4,0.3014,0.0109,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0039,0.013,0.0077,6.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.3362,0.0017,0.0063,0.2341,0.0019,7.0E-4,0.0562,0.002,0.0012,0.021]},{"docId":"40","lemmas":"develop functional service delivery role faculty librarian development functional service delivery model andersonian library focus provision research support","subTopicDistribution":[7.0E-4,0.0679,7.0E-4,0.0033,5.0E-4,0.0018,9.0E-4,0.0036,6.0E-4,0.0017,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0025,0.0032,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,8.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0719,0.0053,5.0E-4,0.0108,0.2308,0.162,0.0016,0.002,0.0375,5.0E-4,0.0198,0.0018,0.0013,0.0014,0.0085,0.3329,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.002,0.0015,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0013,5.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0012,0.0011,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0013,0.0028,0.0071],"numLemmas":18,"docIndex":40,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/15","money":"984","university":"A","abstract":"Looking at the development of functional service delivery models at the Andersonian Library, with focus on the provision for research support.","title":"Developing functional service delivery roles for faculty librarians","authors":"A & B & C & D"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0019,0.0014,0.0013,0.0016,0.0025,0.3069,0.0026,0.0041,0.0012,0.001,0.1474,0.0021,0.3122,0.1429,0.0013,0.0039,0.001,0.0022,0.0037,0.0596]},{"docId":"41","lemmas":"model uncertainty panel vector autoregressive model develop method bayesian model average bma selection bm panel vector autoregression pvar approach select average combination restricted pvar restriction involve interdependency heterogeneity cross sectional unit result bma framework find parsimonious pvar specification deal overparameterization concern method application involve euro area sovereign debt crisis show method perform alternative finding contradict simple view sovereign debt crisis divide euro zone group core peripheral country worry financial contagion group","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,5.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.001,0.001,0.001,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0036,4.0E-4,0.0012,0.0711,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0034,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0037,3.0E-4,0.4605,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0014,0.001,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.099,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0833,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.066,3.0E-4,0.0015,4.0E-4,0.0048,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0886,0.0973],"numLemmas":71,"docIndex":41,"docData":{"date":"05\/12\/16","money":"938","university":"B","abstract":"We develop methods for Bayesian model averaging (BMA) or selection (BMS) in Panel Vector Autoregressions (PVARs).

Here conservation of the magnetic moment converts axial to rotational momentum forming a horseshoe distribution in velocity phase space. This distribution is unstable to cyclotron emission with radiation emitted in the X-mode. Initial studies were conducted in the form of 2D PiC code simulations [1] and a scaled laboratory experiment that was constructed to reproduce the mechanism of AKR. As studies progressed, 3D PiC code simulations were conducted to enable complete investigation of the complex interaction dimensions.

Sensitive timing of rhythms in action and playful invention show age-related advances of creative vitality as the body and brain grow.

However, there is a lack of research into Islamic destination image (Jafari & Scott, 2013; Stephenson, 2014). Existing studies have commented on the differentiation between the expectation formation of Muslim and non-Muslim tourists; however these are often restricted to more secular destinations such as Turkey. Moreover, much of the literature which focuses solely on the Muslim community fails to explore beyond the realms of religious satisfaction of their experiences. This paper explores the journey of experience of Muslim pilgrims during the Islamic pilgrimage to the Umrah. Globally, the Hajj is one of the greatest traveller movements, demonstrating a significant rationale for the study of Islam within the heritage tourism domain. Islamic texts, such as the Quran, endorse traveling with a view to attaining social, physical and spiritual objectives. As such, tourism of various categories is compatible with Islam and inspired by its principles. However, the Hajj and Umrah is a highly commanded activity encompassing devout and monetary planning. Therefore, for some Muslims Hajj is a sacred obligation rather than form of heritage tourism. With this in mind, religious pilgrimage is likely to have a very strong destination image in the minds of Muslim visitors. Therefore, this paper looks not only at sacred obligation but also attitudes such as hedonic value, motivations, socialisation, gift, and evidence. Therefore, our study contributes to a wider understanding of the perceptions and behavioural outcomes of visitors toward Islamic destination image. To do so, we develop a conceptual model based i=on the theory of the \u2018commodity fetishism\u2019. The term \u2018commodity fetishism\u2019 refers to the system through which capitalist societies treat \u2018commodities as if value inhered in the objects themselves, rather than in the amount of real labour expended to produce the object\u2019. Thus, this paper attempts to address two gaps, firstly examining the symbolic importance to pilgrims of material objects of pilgrimage, and secondly examining this symbolic experience in the Islamic context of Umrah.

The algorithm proposed considers simultaneously the adequacy of flow and pressure at the demand nodes; the initial construction cost; the network topology; and a measure of hydraulic capacity reliability. The optimization procedure is based on a general measure of hydraulic performance that combines statistical entropy, network connectivity and hydraulic feasibility. The topological properties of the solutions are accounted for and arbitrary assumptions regarding the quality of infeasible solutions are not applied. In other words, both feasible and infeasible solutions participate in the evolutionary processes; solutions survive and reproduce or perish strictly according to their Pareto-optimality. Removing artificial barriers in this way frees the algorithm to evolve optimal solutions quickly. Furthermore, any redundant binary codes that result from crossover or mutation are eliminated gradually in a seamless and generic way that avoids the arbitrary loss of potentially useful genetic material and preserves the quality of the information that is transmitted from one generation to the next. The approach proposed is entirely generic: we have not introduced any additional parameters that require calibration on a case-by-case basis. Detailed and extensive results for two test problems are included that suggest the approach is highly effective. In general, the frontier-optimal solutions achieved include topologies that are fully branched, partially- and fully-looped and, for networks with multiple sources, completely separate sub-networks.","title":"Optimal design of water distribution systems based on entropy and topology","authors":"D"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0025,0.0016,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0049,0.003,0.0013,0.0049,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0071,0.0023,0.4946,0.0703,0.2007,0.0032,0.0066,0.195,8.0E-4]},{"docId":"153","lemmas":"isolation identification antitrypanosomal antimycobacterial active steroid sponge haliclona simulan marine sponge haliclona simulan collect irish sea yield steroid vinyl cholest ene diol methyl pregn en ol 5a 8a epidioxy widely distribute methylenecholesterol steroid possess unusually short hydrocarbon side chain structure elucidate nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirm electron impact high resolution electrospray mass spectrometry steroid possess antitrypanosomal anti mycobacterial activity steroid find possess low cytotoxicity hs27 detect antitrypanosomal potent concentration","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.1039,4.0E-4,0.0039,2.0E-4,0.0521,8.0E-4,0.0023,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0044,0.0033,0.0105,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.003,6.0E-4,0.2365,0.0078,0.0014,5.0E-4,0.0172,0.0058,7.0E-4,0.0021,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.005,0.0025,2.0E-4,0.0166,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.4867,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0177,4.0E-4,0.0019,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0042,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":69,"docIndex":153,"docData":{"date":"05\/02\/15","money":"210","university":"A","abstract":"The marine sponge Haliclona simulans collected from the Irish Sea yielded two new steroids: 24-vinyl-cholest-9-ene-3β,24-diol and 20-methyl-pregn-6-en-3β-ol,5a,8a-epidioxy, along with the widely distributed 24-methylenecholesterol.

The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90% confidence and 10% precision, known as the 90\/10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering cost minimisation model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II.J. The 90\/10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost minimisation problem. Optimal solutions to the problem minimise the metering cost whilst satisfying the 90\/10 criterion for each reporting period.

Secondly, all of the UK leaders of the main unionist parties committed, in the latter stages of the referendum campaign, to transferring significant additional powers to the Scottish Parliament in the event of a majority no vote.2 Lord Smith of Kelvin Chairs a Commission charged with rapidly generating a proposal for a new devolution settlement for Scotland","title":"Scottish Fiscal Choices Post-Referendum: Powers, Purpose and Potential Impact","authors":"L & K & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0015,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0011,0.1032,0.507,0.0017,7.0E-4,7.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.001,0.0065,0.1165,0.2385,0.001,8.0E-4,0.0029,7.0E-4,0.0146,6.0E-4]},{"docId":"51","lemmas":"unravel nagoya protocol commentary protocol access benefit sharing convention biological diversity nagoya protocol access benefit sharing international environmental agreement concern environmental sustainability sustainable development issue equity address complex subject matter affect range research development commercial activity relevant area international law human rights intellectual property rights health food ocean unravel nagoya protocol identify textual contextual systemic interpretative question suggest solution aim give coherent balanced meaning text protocol offer systematic discussion protocol legal innovation background general international law commentary aim international biodiversity law scholar practitioner international lawyer approach access benefit sharing time","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0018,0.0272,0.001,0.0701,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0377,0.001,0.0012,0.02,3.0E-4,0.1068,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0263,0.4512,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.003,3.0E-4,0.1824,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0591],"numLemmas":90,"docIndex":51,"docData":{"date":"21\/11\/15","money":"643","university":"D","abstract":"The Nagoya Protocol on access and benefit-sharing is an international environmental agreement that concerns environmental sustainability , other sustainable development issues and equity.

In such settings, economic capital is typically largely absent or hard to come by, and dominant institutional structures remain firmly closed to would-be entrepreneurs. Studies are starting to show that - in contrast to dominant market-capitalism rhetorics of the heroic entrepreneur \u2013 that discourses, structures and practices of liberation are often developed by disenfranchised entrepreneurs, and especially through creative and craft entrepreneurship. \n\nApproach: This study explores three case studies of likely entrepreneurial resistance, all drawn from the same network of creative counter-cultural organizations in Athens: a tattoo parlour, a small chain of skate board shops, and a punk rock band. By selecting a sample drawn from the same community, analysis of the local context is enhanced. A mixture of qualitative research methods is used to gather rich longitudinal data, including semi-structured interviews, analysis of the internet and social media artefacts generated by these entrepreneurs, and participant observation. \n\nResults: Participants were centred towards their own worlds, beyond the mainstream (which they largely ignored), and were almost entirely engaged with the creative excellence, emotion and community this generated. \n\nImplications: Marginality, the position of powerlessness, can be deployed as a resource permitting a special kind of liberated entrepreneurship. Not only recognizing the barriers around established institutions (with their norms, and structures of dominance) such entrepreneurship of resistance actually turns being beyond the barriers into a space of freedom, a space of play.\n\nValue: .

Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns.

Little is known, researched or published on the phenomenon and there are currently no apparent full-proof material solutions for the issue. The research presented here looks to develop a fuller understanding of the issue of leading edge erosion, through first reviewing the literature (both within and outwith wind energy) on the topic to put the issues in context, and then subsequently further exploring and investigating the key damage mechanisms associated rain droplet and hailstone impact on the blade leading edge; identified as two of the most erosive types of environmental exposure. Both numerical (finite element) and experimental methods are employed to identify the key damage mechanisms associated with each form of impact in the different possible blade material coating and substrate systems. It is found that for rain exposure, surface degradation and erosion is a real risk for classical gelcoat coating systems. Whereas, for newer flexible and more erosive resistant materials, interface damage and debonding from the substrate is the most likely form of damage creation. Hailstone impact is found to pose a heightened erosive threat in comparison to rain, based on individual impact damage creation; although it is recognised that hailstorms are far more infrequent than rain showers in most regions. However, it is predicted that for extreme hailstones of sufficient mass, significant substrate composite damage could also be created through impact on the leading edge. Future work and further research development aimed at further understanding the issues of blade leading edge erosion are also identified and discussed.","title":"Wind Turbine Blade Leading Edge Erosion: An Investigation of Rain Droplet and Hailstone Impact Induced Damage Mechanisms","authors":"D & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,0.0848,5.0E-4,0.0366,7.0E-4,0.0013,0.0795,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1217,0.1928,0.3965,0.0709,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0108,0.002,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"160","lemmas":"optimize schwarz method curl curl time harmonic maxwell equation helmholtz equation high frequency time harmonic maxwell equation difficult solve classical iterative method domain decomposition method promising follow provably convergent method optimize schwarz method develop decade basic formulation maxwell equation order formulation complete optimize result order curl curl formulation partial optimization result show paper convergence factor optimization process formulation show numerical experiment fourier analysis predict behavior algorithm yee scheme discretization correspond nedelec edge element tensor product mesh curl curl formulation mixed type nedelec element irregular tetrahedral mesh numerical experiment transverse magnetic tm mode resolve high frequency transverse electric te mode heuristic compensate optimization","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0037,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0597,2.0E-4,0.4786,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0741,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.2148,7.0E-4,9.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.005,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.1428,0.0103,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":102,"docIndex":160,"docData":{"date":"29\/11\/18","money":"695","university":"A","abstract":"Like the Helmholtz equation, the high frequency time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are difficult to solve by classical iterative methods.

We show in this paper that the convergence factors and the optimization process for the two formulations are the same. We then show by numerical experiments that the Fourier analysis predicts very well the behavior of the algorithms for a Yee scheme discretization, which corresponds to Nedelec edge elements on a tensor product mesh, in the curl-curl formulation. When using however mixed type Nedelec elements on an irregular tetrahedral mesh, numerical experiments indicate that transverse magnetic (TM) modes are less well resolved for high frequencies than transverse electric (TE) modes, and a heuristic can then be used to compensate for this in the optimization.","title":"Optimized Schwarz methods for curl-curl time-harmonic Maxwell's equations","authors":"A & G"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0994,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0012,0.0015,0.0012,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.5625,0.0029,0.231,3.0E-4,0.0868,0.0012,5.0E-4,0.0096,3.0E-4]},{"docId":"161","lemmas":"percutaneous heart valve past present future percutaneous heart valve provide promising future patient refuse surgery grounds significant technical challenge high risk complication human intervention year ago type valve develop corevalve edward sapien valve experienced clinical trial gain fda approval implantation patient inoperable current complication major vascular bleeding stroke prevent valve commonly deploy patient operable conventional surgery review focus past present achievement valve highlight design consideration require progress development envisage continued improvement valve design increase clinical engineering experience percutaneous heart valve replacement day viable option lower risk operable patient","subTopicDistribution":[0.0021,0.0012,8.0E-4,0.0411,0.0161,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.1443,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0059,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0193,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.2665,0.2429,7.0E-4,6.0E-4,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.1939,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0505,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.001,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0013,5.0E-4],"numLemmas":88,"docIndex":161,"docData":{"date":"28\/05\/18","money":"834","university":"D","abstract":"Percutaneous heart valves provide a promising future for patients refused surgery on the grounds of significant technical challenges or high risk for complications.

Initiatives to moderate growth include pricing regulations for pharmaceuticals and encouraging International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing. However, there is limited monitoring of physician prescribing and current incentives encourage hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement.  The objective was to assess changes in statin utilization and expenditure as additional generics are launched. Subsequently, compare results in China with findings among European countries to provide future guidance.  We used observational retrospective study of statin utilization and procurement expenditure from 2004 to 2013 in two large teaching hospital groups.  The results were that statin utilization rose 32-fold in one hospital group and 54-fold in the other. Expenditure also increased but to a lesser extent, i.e. from just over Renminbi \u2018yuan\u2019 (CNY) 0.65 million in 2004 to CNY 15.3 million in 2013 in one hospital group and from CNY 0.49 to CNY 19.3 million in the other. Atorvastatin (originator) was the most utilized statin. Utilization of each generic statin was typically low, e.g. 10% in 2013 in one hospital group. Procurement prices fell over time, greatest for generic simvastatin (-74% to -91%) mirroring data from European countries. However, no increase in their prescribing was observed. In fact, a significant decrease in generic prescribing was seen in one hospital group between 2004 and 2013.  There are considerable opportunities to improve prescribing efficiency in China based on European experience. However, current incentives encouraging hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement need to be addressed.","title":"Ongoing initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China: statins as a case history","authors":"C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.603,0.0049,9.0E-4,0.0196,0.0829,0.0012,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0598,0.2224,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0022,4.0E-4]},{"docId":"164","lemmas":"load share system reliability model manage component degradation motivate industrial problem affect water utility develop model load share system operator dispatch work load component manner manage degradation assume degradation dominant failure type system subject sudden failure due shock derive time degradation failure system estimate system probability failure generate optimal design obtain minimize long run average cost future system model support asset maintenance design decision model develop common set core assumption operator allocate work balance level degradation condition component achieve system performance system assume replace cumulative work load reach random threshold adopt cumulative work load measure total usage represent primary component degradation model cumulative work load system monotone increase stationary stochastic process cumulative work load degradation failure component assume inverse gaussian distribute inform industry problem present illustrate application model operating scenario","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1525,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1206,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.001,3.0E-4,0.0028,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0055,0.0031,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.4807,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,2.0E-4,0.001,4.0E-4,0.062,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0372,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.1237,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":130,"docIndex":164,"docData":{"date":"26\/07\/17","money":"794","university":"E","abstract":"Motivated by an industrial problem affecting a water utility, we develop a model for a load sharing system where an operator dispatches work load to components in a manner that manages their degradation.

By deriving the time to degradation failure of the system, estimates of system probability of failure are generated, and optimal designs can be obtained to minimize the long run average cost of a future system. The model can be used to support asset maintenance and design decisions. Our model is developed under a common set of core assumptions. That is, the operator allocates work to balance the level of the degradation condition of all components to achieve system performance. A system is assumed to be replaced when the cumulative work load reaches some random threshold. We adopt cumulative work load as the measure of total usage because it represents the primary cause of component degradation. We model the cumulative work load of the system as a monotone increasing and stationary stochastic process.

However, designing energy-efficient buildings is not a straightforward task - the increasing demand for high comfort standards, provided by conventional 'energy-hungry' cooling and heating devices conflicts with the need for demand reduction. Trigeneration, the simultaneous production of electricity, cooling and heating is often viewed as a means of improving energy-efficiency in large and medium sized buildings whilst still delivering thermal comfort. For hot climates, the benefit of utilising the waste heat emitted from an engine unit to power a thermally driven cooling device provides scope to utilise an otherwise wasted energy stream. However, in smaller sized residential buildings, the relatively low and intermittent energy demand coupled with high capital costs, has stifled the uptake of the technology - although the potential for substantial energy savings exists. Moreover, it is very common for home owners in hot climates to opt for other energy-saving devices such as solar water heaters (SWH), which would tend to reduce further the possible demand for space and water heating, possibly making the simultaneous use of both micro-trigeneration and SWH unfeasible. This paper compares the performance of a residential micro-trigeneration system to a hybrid micro-trigeneration\/SWH system. The performance of both systems was simulated using a whole building simulation tool run at a high time resolution. The results obtained were then used to quantify the energetic and environmental performance of both systems; and also to assess their financial viability against the effect of varying fuel prices, electricity tariffs and a varying Feed-in Tariff (FIT). Results show that whereas the solar aided micro-trigeneration system obtains an overall higher (though marginal) energetic and environmental performance, the financial performance for the same fiscal parameters (fuel prices and electricity tariffs) deteriorates. Moreover FIT, plays an important role in the financial feasibility of the system.","title":"Energetic, environmental and economic modelling of a solar-assisted residential micro-trigeneration system in a Mediterranean climate","authors":"M & I"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0013,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1003,3.0E-4,0.0165,0.0675,4.0E-4,0.001,0.0024,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.1517,0.2872,0.0481,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0087,0.3113,0.0013]},{"docId":"168","lemmas":"accurate position tracking optically trap live cell optical trapping powerful tool life science research common place microscopy laboratory facility grow directly trap cell interest introduce bead sample affect fundamental biological function sample impact property user observe measure instability track large inhomogeneous object cell make tracking position calibrate trap strength make reliable measurement challenge instability manifest cell roll orientation occur result viscous drag force thermal convection spontaneously due brownian force paper discuss mathematically model roll present experimental approach tackle issue include beam profile consist closely space trap track trap object analyse fluorescence image approach present trap cell form part adaptive immune response system principle apply wide range sample size inhomogeneous nature trap object hinder particle tracking experiment","subTopicDistribution":[0.0581,0.2135,2.0E-4,0.0013,2.0E-4,0.0304,0.0012,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0686,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0022,3.0E-4,0.0023,9.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0237,9.0E-4,0.4001,0.0797,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.008,0.013,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0829,0.0029,1.0E-4,0.0013,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":116,"docIndex":168,"docData":{"date":"12\/11\/17","money":"517","university":"E","abstract":"Optical trapping is a powerful tool in Life Science research and is becoming common place in many microscopy laboratories and facilities. There is a growing need to directly trap the cells of interest rather than introduce beads to the sample that can affect the fundamental biological functions of the sample and impact on the very properties the user wishes to observe and measure. However, instabilities while tracking large inhomogeneous objects, such as cells, can make tracking position, calibrating trap strength and making reliable measurements challenging. These instabilities often manifest themselves as cell roll or re-orientation and can occur as a result of viscous drag forces and thermal convection, as well as spontaneously due to Brownian forces. In this paper we discuss and mathematically model the cause of this roll and present several experimental approaches for tackling these issues, including using a novel beam profile consisting of three closely spaced traps and tracking a trapped object by analysing fluorescence images. The approaches presented here trap T cells which form part of the adaptive immune response system, but in principle can be applied to a wide range of samples where the size and inhomogeneous nature of the trapped object can hinder particle tracking experiments.","title":"Accurate position tracking of optically trapped live cells","authors":"B & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0017,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0035,0.0011,0.01,0.1303,9.0E-4,0.0015,0.1478,0.1114,0.0818,0.0229,0.4806,5.0E-4,0.0016,2.0E-4,0.0012,0.003,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"169","lemmas":"epidemiological model investigate unwarranted variation case ventilation tube otitis media effusion england objective investigate unwarranted variation ventilation tube insertion otitis media effusion child england procedure overuse clinical audits ventilation tube insertion conform appropriateness criterion national institute health care excellence nice audits identify scale underuse patient benefit treat method explore underuse overuse ventilation tube otitis media effusion develop epidemiological model base definition child otitis media effusion expect benefit ventilation tube accord nice guidance epidemiological clinical information systematic review expert judgement range estimate derive monte carlo simulation compare number ventilation tube provide english national health service result child england expect benefit ventilation tube otitis media effusion year certainty observe number ventilation tube otitis media effusion associate diagnosis conclusion expect population capacity benefit ventilation tube otitis media effusion base nice guidance exceed number ventilation tube provide english national health service overuse substantial underuse ventilation tube otitis media effusion nice criterion apply future investigation unwarranted variation focus patient treat potential benefit population level","subTopicDistribution":[1.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0015,1.0E-4,0.163,0.0712,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.074,0.0026,0.0199,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.2518,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0447,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.1218,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.106,1.0E-4,0.1269,0.0053,0.0017,0.0017,0.001,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":159,"docIndex":169,"docData":{"date":"03\/02\/15","money":"335","university":"A","abstract":"Objectives: To investigate unwarranted variation in ventilation tube insertions for otitis media with effusion in children in England. This procedure is known to be 'overused' from clinical audits, as only one in three ventilation tube insertions conforms to the appropriateness criteria of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); but audits cannot identify the scale of 'underuse' - i.e. patients who would benefit but are not treated.\nMethods:\nTo explore both 'underuse' and 'overuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion, we developed an epidemiological model based on: definitions of children with otitis media with effusion expected to benefit from ventilation tubes according to NICE guidance; epidemiological and clinical information from a systematic review; and expert judgement. A range of estimates was derived using Monte Carlo simulation and compared with the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service in 2010.\nResults:\nAbout 32,200 children in England would be expected to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion per year (between 20,411 and 45,231 with 90% certainty). The observed number of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion-associated diagnoses was 16,824.\nConclusions:\nThe expected population capacity to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion based on NICE guidance appeared to exceed, by far, the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service. So, while there is known 'overuse', there also may be substantial 'underuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion if NICE criteria were applied.

The signaling mechanisms underlying parasite development remain largely elusive even though Leishmania mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been linked previously to environmentally induced differentiation and virulence. Here, we unravel highly unusual regulatory mechanisms for Leishmania MAP kinase 10 (MPK10). Using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that MPK10 is stage-specifically regulated, as its kinase activity increases during the promastigote to amastigote conversion. However, unlike canonical MAPKs that are activated by dual phosphorylation of the regulatory TxY motif in the activation loop, MPK10 activation is independent from the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue, which is largely constitutive. Removal of the last 46 amino acids resulted in significantly enhanced MPK10 activity both for the recombinant and transgenic protein, revealing that MPK10 is regulated by an auto-inhibitory mechanism. Over-expression of this hyperactive mutant in transgenic parasites led to a dominant negative effect causing massive cell death during amastigote differentiation, demonstrating the essential nature of MPK10 auto-inhibition for parasite viability. Moreover, phosphoproteomics analyses identified a novel regulatory phospho-serine residue in the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain at position 395 that could be implicated in kinase regulation. Finally, we uncovered a feedback loop that limits MPK10 activity through dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the TxY motif. Together our data reveal novel aspects of protein kinase regulation in Leishmania, and propose MPK10 as a potential signal sensor of the mammalian host environment, whose intrinsic pre-activated conformation is regulated by auto-inhibition.","title":"Transgenic analysis of the Leishmania MAP kinase MPK10 reveals an auto-inhibitory mechanism crucial for stage-regulated activity and parasite viability","authors":"I & J"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0044,0.0125,5.0E-4,0.0014,4.0E-4,0.0014,0.0052,0.001,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.6842,7.0E-4,0.0068,0.1739,0.0692,0.0012,0.0021,0.0096,0.0017,0.0239]},{"docId":"64","lemmas":"dabigatran continue exemplar case history demonstrate comprehensive model optimize utilization drug background potential conflict authority company fund premium price drug effectiveness safety budget concern dabigatran oral anticoagulant prevention stroke patient valvular atrial fibrillation af exemplify issue whilst effective treatment issue elderly dabigatran due variable drug concentration antidote dependence renal elimination publish study show dabigatran cost effective budget concern give prevalence af concern result extensive activity pre post launch manage introduction objective review authority activity country ii finding develop model manage entry drug iii review implication base post launch activity methodology descriptive review appraisal activity regard dabigatran ii development guidance key stakeholder group iterative process iii refining guidance follow post launch study result plethora activity manage dabigatran include extensive pre launch activity risk share arrangement prescribe restriction monitoring prescribe post launch reimbursement deny country due concern budget impact excessive bleeding development model future guidance propose manage entry drug center pillar pre perus post launch activity post launch activity include increase patient registry monitor safety effectiveness drug clinical practice conclusion model introduce drug essential optimize prescribe concern model drug withdraw prematurely struggle fund godman malmstr diogene jayathissa mctaggart car alvarez madrazo baumg rtel brzezinska bucsic campbell eriksson finlayson rst garuoliene gutus rrez ibarluzea hvide herholz joppi kalaba laius malinowska pedersen markovic pekovic piessnegger selke sermet spillane tomek von ina vlahovus pal evski wale wladysiuk van woerkom zara gustafsson","subTopicDistribution":[0.0081,0.001,0.0018,0.0116,0.01,3.0E-4,0.0017,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0064,0.0612,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.001,6.0E-4,0.0073,0.0057,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0653,0.1666,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0023,3.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.3264,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.005,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.007,1.0E-4,0.0087,3.0E-4,0.013,0.2822,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":226,"docIndex":64,"docData":{"date":"04\/02\/18","money":"797","university":"E","abstract":"Background: There are potential conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially where there are effectiveness, safety and\/or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies showed dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. These concerns resulted in extensive activities pre- to post-launch to manage its introduction. Objective: To (i) review authority activities across countries, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications based on post-launch activities. Methodology: (i) Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran, (ii) development of guidance for key stakeholder groups through an iterative process, (iii) refining guidance following post launch studies. Results: Plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and\/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, centering on three pillars of pre-, peri-, and post-launch activities. Post-launch activities include increasing use of patient registries to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in clinical practice. Conclusion: Models for introducing new drugs are essential to optimize their prescribing especially where concerns. Without such models, new drugs may be withdrawn prematurely and\/or struggle for funding. © 2014 Godman, Malmström, Diogene, Jayathissa, McTaggart, Cars, Alvarez-Madrazo, Baumgärtel, Brzezinska, Bucsics, Campbell, Eriksson, Finlayson, Fürst, Garuoliene, Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea, Hviding, Herholz, Joppi, Kalaba, Laius, Malinowska, Pedersen, Markovic-Pekovic, Piessnegger, Selke, Sermet, Spillane, Tomek, Vončina, Vlahović-Palčevski, Wale, Wladysiuk, van Woerkom, Zara and Gustafsson.","title":"Dabigatran - a continuing exemplar case history demonstrating the need for comprehensive models to optimize the utilization of new drugs","authors":"K & L & M"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,0.1992,0.1557,0.0054,0.0034,0.0997,9.0E-4,0.0015,3.0E-4,0.0591,0.0017,0.0207,0.249,0.1775,5.0E-4,0.0075,0.016,8.0E-4,0.001,6.0E-4]},{"docId":"65","lemmas":"development learning task process orient diagnostic developmental speech sound disorder pilot study differential diagnosis treatment planning speech sound disorder ssd major bottleneck field pediatric speech language pathology current study comprise development evaluation learning task design provide insight process involve acquisition sensori motor representation speech sound unit develop child aged yr child ssd aged yr participate pilot study learn paradigm comprise repetition task speech sound unit present child mother tongue consonant cluster ml follow condition repetition variation statistical analysis reveal significant main effect learn significant difference group group learn interaction detailed analysis individual data show underlie profile vary widely child ssd result highlight role prosody ssd suggest trade accuracy segmental supra segmental level preliminary result promise profiling ssd suggest detailed assessment acquisition sensorus motor representation provide direct start point therapy","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0026,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0011,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.036,0.0016,0.1494,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.4042,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.062,0.0076,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1243,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.002,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.1754,3.0E-4,0.0023,2.0E-4,0.0197,1.0E-4,0.0027,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,8.0E-4],"numLemmas":129,"docIndex":65,"docData":{"date":"03\/10\/16","money":"826","university":"B","abstract":"Differential diagnosis and treatment planning of speech sound disorders (SSD) is one of the major bottlenecks in the field of pediatric speech-language pathology.

Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of learning as well as significant differences between groups, but no group by learning interactions. Detailed analysis of the individual data show underlying profiles to vary widely per child with SSD. Furthermore, results highlighted the role of prosody in SSD, suggesting a trade-off between accuracy at the segmental and supra-segmental levels. These preliminary results are promising for the profiling of SSD and suggest that a detailed assessment of the acquisition of novel sensori-motor representations may provide direct starting points for therapy.","title":"Development of a learning task for a process-oriented diagnostics of developmental speech sound disorders: a pilot study","authors":"M & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,0.0436,0.2848,6.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.1515,8.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0021,7.0E-4,0.0012,0.0011,0.0612,0.4236,0.0011,0.0014,0.0147,0.0088,0.0017,3.0E-4]},{"docId":"66","lemmas":"dynamic optimal power flow active distribution network active network management philosophy operation distribution network high penetration renewable distribute generation technology energy storage flexible demand begin include active network management anm scheme optimize operation scheme require consideration inter temporal linkage network power flow effect network effect include optimal power flow opf solution optimize single point time dynamic optimal power flow dopf extension opf cover multiple time period paper review generic formulation dynamic optimal power flow develop framework modeling energy technology inter temporal characteristic anm context framework include optimization firm connect generation principle access firm generator energy storage flexible demand objective base maximize export revenue develop case study illustrate technique result show dopf successfully schedule energy technology dopf schedule energy storage flexible demand reduce generator curtailment significantly case study finally role dopf analyze anm scheme discuss reference extend optimization framework include technology objective","subTopicDistribution":[1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.3975,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0669,8.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0478,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.3893,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0803,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0084,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.002],"numLemmas":141,"docIndex":66,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/15","money":"276","university":"D","abstract":"Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation.Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes.

Network effects are included in Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of Dynamic Optimal Power Flow before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with inter-temporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of non-firm connected generation, Principles of Access for non-firm generators, energy storage and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.","title":"Dynamic optimal power flow for active distribution networks","authors":"B & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,6.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.001,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0452,0.0746,0.3571,7.0E-4,0.034,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.4834,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"67","lemmas":"photonic networking data centre light rapidly increase demand ultra high speed data transmission data centre pressure provide increase data transmission network time improve quality data handle term reduce latency increase scalability improve channel speed user data rate increase present electronic switching technology current data centre architecture increasingly difficult scale improved data management paper electronic scalability issue discuss alternative optical solution review include highly scalable optical interconnect","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1052,1.0E-4,0.0013,0.0108,7.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0027,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0015,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0095,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.5769,6.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0944,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0713,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.1009,0.0015,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0135,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4],"numLemmas":66,"docIndex":67,"docData":{"date":"08\/09\/18","money":"843","university":"A","abstract":"In light of rapidly increasing demand for ultra-high speed data transmission, data centres are under pressure to provide ever increasing data transmission through their networks and at the same time improve the quality of data handling in terms of reduced latency, increased scalability and improved channel speed for users.

The concept of customer engagement aggregates the multiple ways customer behaviors beyond transactions may influence the firm.

This paper marks the first attempt to conceptualize the role of customer engagement behavior (CEB) in value co-creation within a multi-stakeholder service system. We combine the theoretical perspectives of customer engagement and value co-creation research to the analysis of a rich case study of a public transport service system involving consumers, communities, businesses, and governmental organizations. Our findings describe drivers for CEB, identify four types of CEB, and explore the value outcomes experienced by various stakeholders. This paper proposes that CEB affects value co-creation by virtue of customers\u2019 diverse resource contributions towards the focal firm and\/other stakeholders that modify and\/or augment the offering, and\/or affect other stakeholders\u2019 perceptions, preferences, expectations or actions towards the firm or its offering. Through inducing broader resource integration, CEB makes value co-creation a system level process. We offer nine research propositions explicating the connections CEB has to value co-creation by focal customers, the focal firm and other stakeholders. Our research suggests that firms focus greater attention on the resources that customers can contribute, explore the potential to engage diverse stakeholders around a common cause and employ organically emerging systems which provide opportunities for more extensive value co-creation.","title":"The role of customer engagement behavior in value co-creation: a service system perspective","authors":"E & F"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.004,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.015,0.0209,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0012,0.7552,0.1115,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0877,5.0E-4]},{"docId":"69","lemmas":"pivot make zx calculus complete real stabilizer show pivot property graph state derive axiom zx calculus pivot imply local complementation graph state zx calculus augment pivot strictly weaker calculus augment euler decomposition hadamard gate derive angle free version zx calculus show complete real stabilizer quantum mechanic","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,0.001,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0033,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0019,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0044,0.0032,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0032,0.0047,0.1638,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.169,0.001,8.0E-4,8.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0031,6.0E-4,0.6035,7.0E-4,0.006,0.001,0.0016,0.0024,0.0046,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,7.0E-4,0.0069,3.0E-4,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0022,4.0E-4,0.0015],"numLemmas":46,"docIndex":69,"docData":{"date":"08\/02\/18","money":"634","university":"C","abstract":"We show that pivoting property of graph states cannot be derived from the axioms of the ZX-calculus, and that pivoting does not imply local complementation of graph states.

The ecosystem is explained and quantified, clarifying the distinction between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union, which the White Paper, Scotland\u2019s Future, has blurred. Aspects of the White Paper relating to the sector are highlighted and discussed. The proposed relationship between an independent  Scotland (iScotland) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) is unclear within the White Paper. As the spirit adopted in the White Paper is wherever possible to continue co-operation with existing UK bodies this scenario is considered, with membership of ESA via UKSA, alongside direct membership of ESA. Scottish independence could be said to be worth £15 \u2013 20 million per year to the sector in the medium-term, and the long-term size and scale of the sector may be of order £100 million; almost triple the current size. However, this is dependent on the relationship established between iScotland and the rest-of-the-UK (rUK), and appears to require a contravention of the spirit of the White Paper. How iScotland chooses to maintain a formal relationship with UKSA is thus of vital importance, having both economic and legal implications. Seeking a continuing relationship would require agreement about delegation of ministerial power, sovereign funds and indemnity provisions in response to any government liability for damage. As regards membership of ESA and EUMETSAT in particular, the existing member states are required to agree to accession by iScotland and to set the conditions; any disruption or lack of access to international organisations, including the EU, could be a potentially significant problem. Post-independence, the scope of UK nationality, as opposed to citizenship, would also require clarification in the context of space and any on-going relationship with UKSA.\n\nThe relationship with EUMETSAT via co-funding contributions to the Met Office requires further thought but does appear in principle to be a viable option. The same judgement of \u2018viable\u2019 can be reached when considering the Scottish government\u2019s proposals around the Research Councils. However, whilst an approach may be viable, no assessment or judgement is offered as to its desirability from either an iScottish or rUK perspective.","title":"Impact assessment of Scottish independence on the space sector","authors":"A & G"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.001,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.073,0.1801,0.0028,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0053,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.4055,0.2815,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0478,3.0E-4]},{"docId":"171","lemmas":"counsel versus low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy persistent threshold mild depression clicd study protocol pilot feasibility randomise controlled trial persistent threshold depressive symptom important patient experience symptom year develop major depressive episode national institute health care excellence unite kingdom recommend research efficacy person centre counselling low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy persistent threshold mild depression arm parallel group pilot randomise trial test key component trial delivery participant patient diagnosis persistent threshold depressive symptom mild depression recruit general practice glasgow scotland eligible patient randomise receive person centre counsel pcc low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy li cbt primary outcome measure recruitment adherence retention rate month baseline secondary outcome measure change month grid hamd recovery prevention depression accord dsm iv diagnosis month change month phq wsas eq5d sf12v2 mh enhance provide estimate adequate precision design future study recruitment rate proportion follow month identify potential moderator outcome evidence comparative effectiveness commonly psychological treatment person centre counselling low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy lack patient threshold mild depression study provide information construct trial compare treatment inform early intervention treatment strategy condition","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.0013,3.0E-4,0.0011,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1084,6.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0442,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1846,0.0011,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0051,0.1236,5.0E-4,0.0255,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0034,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0603,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0087,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.4093,1.0E-4,0.0017,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0156,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":174,"docIndex":171,"docData":{"date":"18\/03\/18","money":"528","university":"C","abstract":"Persistent sub-threshold depressive symptoms are important because almost all patients who experience symptoms for more than 2 years go on to develop major depressive episodes.

A two-arm, parallel group, pilot randomised trial to test the key components of trial delivery. The participants will be 50 patients with the diagnosis of persistent sub-threshold depressive symptoms and mild depression, recruited at five general practices in Glasgow, Scotland. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either Person-Centred Counselling (PCC) or Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (LI-CBT).

Dilution experiments were conducted during the two cruises to investigate the growth and grazing among picophytoplantkon populations. Comparisons of phytoplankton growth (μ0) and microzooplankton grazing rates (m) on seasonal (summer and winter), spatial (plume, transitional and Kuroshio regions) and vertical (surface and depth of chlorophyll maximum) scales were made. The three picophytoplankton populations occupied different ecological niches and showed different distribution patterns (especially in summer), which is, however, not coincident with their maximum growth rate. The distribution and population transition of picophytoplankton is therefore a result of the balance between growth and grazing mortality. Average growth rates (μ0) for Prochlorococcus (Pro), Synechococcus (Syn) and picoeukaryotes (Peuk) were 0.36, 0.81 and 0.90 d−1 in summer, and 0.46, 0.58 and 0.56 d−1 in winter, respectively. Average grazing mortality rates (m) were 0.46, 0.63 and 0.68 d−1 in summer, and 0.25, 0.22 and 0.23 d−1 in winter for Pro, Syn and Peuk, respectively. The spatial pattern of both growth and grazing mortality rates showed decreasing trends from the inshore to offshore region, indicating a strong influence of the nutrient gradient induced by Yangtze River input. In summer, Pro, Syn and Peuk were dominant in Kuroshio, transitional and plume regions, respectively, while in winter all the three populations tended to thrive in the offshore regions, particularly for Pro and Syn. Vertically, picophytoplankton exhibited the highest abundance at ~ 20 m in summer and at the surface in winter. Both growth rate and grazing mortality were higher at the surface than in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. On average, protist grazing consumed 84, 79 and 74% and 45, 47 and 57% of production for Pro, Syn and Peuk in summer and winter, respectively.","title":"Seasonal and spatial patterns of picophytoplankton growth, grazing and distribution in the East China Sea","authors":"B & L"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0022,0.0523,0.0739,0.3926,3.0E-4,0.004,0.0058,0.0032,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0192,0.0057,0.0051,0.307,0.095,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0319,8.0E-4,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"179","lemmas":"enhance inactivation escherichia coli listeria monocytogenes exposure nm light lethal temperature salt acid stress condition antimicrobial effect nm light generate interest emerge disinfection technology potential food related application aim study assess bactericidal efficacy nm light inactivation escherichia coli listeria monocytogenes lethally stress environmental condition bacterium expose nm light light emit diode lead array temperature salt nacl acid condition determine bacterial susceptibility nm light inactivation affect expose condition stressed bacterial population cfu ml expose increase dose nm light mw cm2 inactivation result compare generate stress condition bacterium hold temperature acid concentration ph salt concentration nacl simultaneously expose nm light enhance inactivation coli monocytogene achieve light exposure combine lethal stress significantly increase inactivation rate compare stressed population exception monocytogene light expose presence salt combination reduce bacterial inactivation greatest enhancement nm light inactivation bacterial species achieve light exposure combine lethal acid stress condition ph demonstrate log10 reduction coli follow nm light dose cm2 compare cm2 stressed population reduction dose log10 reduction monocytogene achieve dose cm2 correspond dose require equivalent reduction stressed population acid enhance nm light inactivation effect demonstrate coli monocytogene disperse liquid suspension deposit test surface result study show lethally stress bacterium increase susceptibility nm light inactivation provide synergistic inactivation effect finding increase potential light base decontamination technology food related application","subTopicDistribution":[1.0E-4,0.0543,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.2374,0.0494,0.0842,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0188,0.0132,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0093,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0043,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.482,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0413,1.0E-4,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":209,"docIndex":179,"docData":{"date":"01\/10\/15","money":"402","university":"C","abstract":"The antimicrobial effects of 405 nm light have generated interest in its use as an emerging disinfection technology with potential food-related applications. The aim of this study was to assess the bactericidal efficacy of 405 nm light for inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes under sub-lethally stressed environmental conditions. Bacteria were exposed to 405 nm light from a light emitting diode (LED) array under various temperature, salt (NaCl) and acid conditions to determine if bacterial susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation is affected when exposed under these conditions. Non-stressed bacterial populations (105 CFU\/mL) were exposed to increasing doses of 405 nm light (~ 70 mW\/cm2) and the inactivation results were compared with those generated under stress conditions. Bacteria were held at various temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C and 45 °C), acid concentrations (pH 3, 3.5 and 7) and salt concentrations (0%, 0.8%, 10% and 15% NaCl), and simultaneously exposed to 405 nm light. Enhanced inactivation of both E. coli and L. monocytogenes was achieved when light exposure was combined with each of the sub-lethal stresses, with significantly increased inactivation rates compared to non-stressed populations (P ≤ 0.05). One exception was with L. monocytogenes when light-exposed in the presence of 15% salt, as this combination reduced bacterial inactivation. The greatest enhancement of 405 nm light inactivation for both bacterial species was achieved when light exposure was combined with sub-lethal acid stress conditions at pH 3. This was demonstrated by a 5-log10 reduction of E. coli following a 405 nm light dose of 84 J\/cm2 compared to 378 J\/cm2 for non-stressed populations (77% reduction in dose) and by a 5-log10 reduction of L. monocytogenes achieved with a dose of 42 J\/cm2 which corresponded to 50% of the dose required for the equivalent reduction of non-stressed populations. This acid-enhanced 405 nm light inactivation effect was demonstrated with E. coli and L. monocytogenes when dispersed in liquid suspension and when deposited on a test surface. Overall, results from this study have shown that sub-lethally stressed bacteria have increased susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation, thereby providing a synergistic inactivation effect, findings which increase the potential of this new light-based decontamination technology for food related applications.","title":"Enhanced inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes by exposure to 405 nm light under sub-lethal temperature, salt and acid stress conditions","authors":"E & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0077,4.0E-4,0.0011,0.3255,0.0755,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.3045,5.0E-4,0.0117,0.2193,0.0038,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.0474]},{"docId":"70","lemmas":"inverse design implementation wavelength demultiplex grate coupler nanophotonic emerge powerful tool manipulate light chip today device design slow ineffective brute force search method lead case limited device performance article provide complete demonstration recently propose inverse design technique user design constraint form target field dielectric constant profile method demonstrate demultiplexing grate grate develop conventional technique accept vertical incident gaussian beam free space separate band nm band nm light separate waveguide inverse design concept simple extendable broad class highly compact device include frequency filter mode converter spatial mode multiplexer","subTopicDistribution":[0.0192,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0066,0.0068,0.0241,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0994,4.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.002,0.0023,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.001,0.0086,6.0E-4,0.0079,4.0E-4,0.0117,1.0E-4,0.3673,0.0014,5.0E-4,0.0029,2.0E-4,0.0014,0.2474,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.1061,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0532,0.0123,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0057,2.0E-4,0.0038,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,8.0E-4],"numLemmas":87,"docIndex":70,"docData":{"date":"10\/08\/15","money":"739","university":"C","abstract":"Nanophotonics has emerged as a powerful tool for manipulating light on chips.

This inverse design concept is simple and extendable to a broad class of highly compact devices including frequency filters, mode converters, and spatial mode multiplexers.","title":"Inverse design and implementation of a wavelength demultiplexing grating coupler","authors":"L & K & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0424,0.0011,7.0E-4,0.0016,0.0013,0.0035,0.301,0.007,0.0029,0.0013,6.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.04,0.3855,7.0E-4,0.1295,5.0E-4,0.035,0.045,5.0E-4]},{"docId":"71","lemmas":"tuning adsorption aromatic molecule platinum halogenation interaction aromatic molecule metal surface key relevance functionality molecular electronics organic electronics device control tune binding property molecule metal chemical functionalization adsorption halogenated benzene molecule surface platinum investigate density functional theory calculation nonlocal van der waal correlation functional find system exhibit bistable adsorption energy profile meta stable chemisorption physisorption state separate potential energy barrier relative stability state tune functionalize benzene number type halogen atom result suggest simple rational molecular design achieve desire interfacial binding organic electronic device composite interface large aromatic molecule metal","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,0.1484,0.0011,0.0196,2.0E-4,0.0038,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0595,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0012,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.001,0.0098,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.2571,1.0E-4,0.2367,0.0023,0.2193,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.0039,7.0E-4,0.0014,2.0E-4,0.0134,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0119,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4],"numLemmas":89,"docIndex":71,"docData":{"date":"01\/06\/19","money":"529","university":"D","abstract":"The interaction of aromatic molecules with metal surfaces is of key relevance for the functionality of molecular electronics and organic electronics devices.

Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs \u2013 achieving 29\u201379% precision and 40\u201370% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins.

Previous studies have intimated that 1 existed as a single species in THF solution formulated as [(THF)·Li(μ-TMP)(μ-iBu)Al( iBu)2] 1·THF, having a contacted ion pair structure as evidenced by an X-ray crystallographic study of isolated crystals.

Cancer incidence and mortality rates in Korea are the highest among all Asian countries, and smoking prevalence in Korean men is one of the highest in developed countries. The purpose of the current study was to perform a systematic review and provide an evidence-based assessment of the burden of tobacco smoking-related cancers in the Korean population. Sex- and cancer-specific population-attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using the prevalence of ever-smoking and second-hand smoking in 1989 among Korean adults, respectively, and the relative risks were estimated from the meta-analysis of studies performed in the Korean population for ever-smoking and in the Asian population for passive smoking. National cancer incidence data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and national cancer mortality data from Statistics Korea for the year 2009 were used to estimate the cancer cases and deaths attributable to tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20,239 (20.9%) cancer incident cases and 14,377 (32.9%) cancer deaths among adult men and 1,930 (2.1%) cancer incident cases and 1,351 (5.2%) cancer deaths among adult women in 2009 in Korea. In men, 71% of lung cancer deaths, 55%-72% of upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus and larynx) cancer deaths, 23% of liver, 32% of stomach, 27% of pancreas, 7% of kidney and 45% of bladder cancer deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking. In women the proportion of ever-smoking-attributable lung cancer was 8.1%, while that attributable to second-hand smoking among non-smoking women was 20.5%. Approximately one in three cancer deaths would be potentially preventable through appropriate control of tobacco smoking in Korean men at the population level and individual level. For Korean women, more lung cancer cases and deaths were attributable to second-hand than ever-smoking.

On suitable Poincare sections, solar sail sets are constructed to obtain transit conditions from LPOs of the departure dynamical system to either LPOs or DPOs of the arrival one. Starting from initial guesses that assume a constant attitude of the solar sail, an optimal control problem is formulated, encompassing a trade-off between minimum transfer time and minimum solar sail steering effort, and it is solved with a direct pseudospectral method.

Specifically, we systematically investigate the influence of hydrodynamics (velocity, flow rate, aperture) on microbially mediated calcite precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that a feedback mechanism exists between the gradual reduction in fracture aperture due to precipitation, and its effect on the local fluid velocity. This feedback results in mineral fill distributions that focus flow into a small number of self-organizing channels that remain open, ultimately controlling the final aperture profile that governs flow within the fracture.

The Ankyrin-repeat (ANK) domains of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 mediated strong and selective interactions with SNAP25\/CSP, whereas binding of zDHHC3 and zDHHC7 to these proteins was barely detectable. Despite this, zDHHC3\/zDHHC7 could S-acylate SNAP25\/CSP more efficiently than zDHHC17, whereas zDHHC13 lacked S-acylation activity toward these proteins.

In biomedical imaging, patients are now regularly imaged using both single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and x-ray computed tomography (CT), or using both positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In non-destructive testing of materials both neutron CT (NCT) and x-ray CT are widely applied to investigate the inner structure of material or track the dynamics of physical processes. The potential benefits from combining modalities has led to increased interest in iterative reconstruction algorithms that can utilize the data from more than one imaging mode simultaneously. We present a new regularization term in iterative reconstruction that enables information from one imaging modality to be used as a structural prior to improve resolution of the second modality. The regularization term is based on a modified anisotropic tensor diffusion filter, that has shape-adapted smoothing properties. By considering the underlying orientations of normal and tangential vector fields for two co-registered images, the diffusion flux is rotated and scaled adaptively to image features. The images can have different greyscale values and different spatial resolutions. The proposed approach is particularly good at isolating oriented features in images which are important for medical and materials science applications. By enhancing the edges it enables both easy identification and volume fraction measurements aiding segmentation algorithms used for quantification. The approach is tested on a standard denoising and deblurring image recovery problem, and then applied to 2D and 3D reconstruction problems; thereby highlighting the capabilities of the algorithm. Using synthetic data from SPECT co-registered with MRI, and real NCT data co-registered with x-ray CT, we show how the method can be used across a range of imaging modalities.","title":"A novel technique to incorporate structural prior information into multi-modal tomographic reconstruction","authors":"K & L & M"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.096,5.0E-4,0.0012,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0022,0.0298,4.0E-4,0.0055,3.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.1009,0.0019,0.4599,4.0E-4,0.004,0.0592,0.2249,0.0076,0.005]},{"docId":"85","lemmas":"external lightning protection system wind turbine blade preliminary aerodynamic result general component make lightning protection system wind turbine receptor conductor ground grid receptor conductor find recent wind turbine blade conductor install internal side blade blade vulnerable damage burn result lightning strike author system external conductor reduce risk damage compare system internal conductor envisage external conductor similar install building aircraft external conductor compromise aerodynamic performance turbine blade paper report effect external conductor pressure coefficient distribution turbine blade blade profile aerofoil accord naca numerical simulation computational fluid dynamics cfd conduct aerofoil external conductor mm thickness turbulence model incorporate comsol multiphysic cfd module simulation wind speed angle attack preliminary result show degradation aerodynamic property significant external conductor arrangement","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0029,0.0031,1.0E-4,0.0012,2.0E-4,0.2849,6.0E-4,0.0013,7.0E-4,0.0035,0.0133,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0428,0.1748,0.0013,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.3472,0.001,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.0173,5.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0136,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0811,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0018,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":115,"docIndex":85,"docData":{"date":"03\/10\/19","money":"748","university":"B","abstract":"In general, there are three components making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an external down conductor is likely to reduce the risk of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an external down conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, external down conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of external down conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade profile (aerofoil) used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with external down conductors of 1mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m\/s and 5˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that external down conductor arrangement could be considered.","title":"External lightning protection system for wind turbine blades: preliminary aerodynamic results","authors":"M & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[6.0E-4,0.142,5.0E-4,6.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0024,0.0014,5.0E-4,0.0055,4.0E-4,0.0114,0.09,0.0066,0.3808,0.2114,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0042,0.1407,4.0E-4]},{"docId":"86","lemmas":"systematic design lead lag network method active damp lcl filter base phase converter phase active rectifier guarantee sinusoidal input current unity power factor price high switching frequency ripple adopt lcl filter filter reduce inductance preserve dynamics stability problem arise current control loop present resonance properly damp passive damp simply add resistor series lcl filter capacitor simplicity expense increase loss encumbrance active damp modify control algorithm attain stability dissipative element additional sensor solution address publication lead lag network method report procedure continue direct tuning procedure trial error rationale explain paper straightforward procedure develop tune lead lag network software tool rationale procedure base capacitor current feedback elucidate stability study means root locus analysis plane select lead lag network maximum damp closed loop pole simple optimization algorithm robustness grid inductance variation analyze simulation experiment confirm validity propose design flow","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,8.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0215,2.0E-4,0.0033,2.0E-4,0.001,0.0019,0.0018,0.0025,1.0E-4,0.0187,0.007,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0047,4.0E-4,0.0187,0.0064,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.3515,4.0E-4,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0108,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0245,0.0081,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.452,0.0379,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,8.0E-4,9.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.001,3.0E-4,0.0172,1.0E-4,0.0011],"numLemmas":136,"docIndex":86,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/17","money":"985","university":"D","abstract":"Three-phase active rectifiers guarantee sinusoidal input currents and unity power factor at the price of a high switching frequency ripple. To adopt an LCL-filter, instead of an $L$-filter, allows using reduced values for the inductances and so preserving dynamics. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop if the present resonance is not properly damped. Passive damping simply adds resistors in series with the LCL-filter capacitors. This simplicity is at the expense of increased losses and encumbrances. Active damping modifies the control algorithm to attain stability without using dissipative elements but, sometimes, needing additional sensors. This solution has been addressed in many publications. The lead-lag network method is one of the first reported procedures and continues being in use. However, neither there is a direct tuning procedure (without trial and error) nor its rationale has been explained. Thus, in this paper a straightforward procedure is developed to tune the lead-lag network with the help of software tools. The rationale of this procedure, based on the capacitor current feedback, is elucidated. Stability is studied by means of the root locus analysis in $z$-plane. Selecting the lead-lag network for the maximum damping in the closed-loop poles uses a simple optimization algorithm. The robustness against the grid inductance variation is also analyzed. Simulations and experiments confirm the validity of the proposed design flow.","title":"Systematic design of the lead-lag network method for active damping in LCL-filter based three phase converters","authors":"B & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[8.0E-4,5.0E-4,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0086,7.0E-4,0.0019,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.001,0.0036,0.3919,3.0E-4,0.0122,0.0864,5.0E-4,0.489,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"87","lemmas":"combine wind turbine fatigue ultimate load reduction individual blade control blade wind turbine individual pitch actuator possibility employ pitch system mitigate structural load advanced control method previously considerable reduction blade lifetime equivalent fatigue load achieve individual blade control ibc addition show potential blade ultimate load reduction fatigue ultimate load impact design life wind turbine blade paper design application ibc concurrently reduce blade fatigue ultimate load investigate contribution blade load spectral component 1p 2p edgewise mode blade plane plane bend moment firstly explore control option reduce combination load component compare response spectral peak fatigue ultimate load controller design act frequency component vary wind speed performance ibc controller fatigue ultimate load reduction assess simulate 5mw exemplar wind turbine simulation result show proper selection control input wind speed single combined ibc achieve satisfactory reduction fatigue ultimate load","subTopicDistribution":[0.0025,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,1.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0109,0.134,3.0E-4,0.0013,0.0189,8.0E-4,7.0E-4,8.0E-4,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.3859,0.0014,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.291,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,8.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0039,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0099,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,7.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0044,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,0.125,2.0E-4,2.0E-4],"numLemmas":134,"docIndex":87,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/19","money":"699","university":"A","abstract":"If each blade of the wind turbine has individual pitch actuator, there is possibility of employing the pitch system to mitigate structural loads through advanced control methods. Previously, considerable reduction of blade lifetime equivalent fatigue loads has been achieved by Individual Blade Control (IBC) and in addition, it has also been shown the potential in blade ultimate loads reduction. However, both fatigue and ultimate loads impact on the design and life of wind turbine blades. In this paper, the design and application of IBC that concurrently reduce both blade fatigue and ultimate loads is investigated. The contributions of blade load spectral components, which are 1P, 2P and edgewise mode from blade in-plane and\/or out-of-plane bending moments, are firstly explored. Four different control options for reducing various combinations of these load components are compared. In response to the different spectral peaks of both fatigue and ultimate loads, the controller has been designed so that it can act on different frequency components which vary with wind speed. The performance of the IBC controller on fatigue and ultimate load reduction is assessed by simulating a 5MW exemplar wind turbine. Simulation results show that with a proper selection of controlling inputs at different wind speed, the use of a single combined IBC can achieve satisfactory reduction on both fatigue and ultimate loads.","title":"Combined wind turbine fatigue and ultimate load reduction by individual blade control","authors":"B & C & D"},"mainTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,0.3615,7.0E-4,0.0013,3.0E-4,0.0018,0.0245,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0011,0.0014,0.4127,0.1401,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0525,2.0E-4]},{"docId":"88","lemmas":"standardized handwriting assess bradykinesia micrographia tremor parkinson disease assess standardized handwriting provide quantitative measure distinguish patient diagnose parkinson disease age gender match healthy control participant exploratory study pen tip trajectory record circle spiral line drawing repeat character elelelel sentence write perform parkinson patient healthy control participant parkinson patient test overnight withdrawal anti parkinsonian medication university medical center groningen tertiary care netherland patient parkinson disease age year male healthy control age year male movement time velocity detect bradykinesia size write detect micrographia rest recording investigate presence rest tremor frequency analysis disease duration parkinson group year patient modify hoehn yahr stage general parkinson patient slower healthy control participant median time repetition median velocity median acceleration sentence task median velocity elel task differ significantly parkinson patient healthy control participant parkinson patient write smaller healthy control participant width elel task significantly smaller parkinson patient compare healthy control participant rest tremor detect patient clinically assess rest tremor study show standardized handwriting provide objective measure bradykinesia tremor micrographia distinguish parkinson patient healthy control participant","subTopicDistribution":[1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.2886,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.0083,0.0026,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0698,0.0319,0.0292,0.015,3.0E-4,0.0026,0.182,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.009,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0031,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0037,5.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.3057,0.0057,0.0344,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,0.001,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":168,"docIndex":88,"docData":{"date":"08\/05\/18","money":"694","university":"E","abstract":"To assess whether standardized handwriting can provide quantitative measures to distinguish patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease from age- and gender-matched healthy control participants.

The results from TVA and TGA analyses show that the APP foam undergoes a significantly different degradation mechanism to the standard foam that we have reported on previously. The TGA results revealed the presence of a two-stage degradation process under a non-oxidative environment. The TVA results, on the other hand, revealed that degradation of the APP foam in fact occurs in four overlapping steps compared to the two-step process which occurs for the standard foam. The additional degradation steps observed for the APP foam are proposed to correspond to degradation of the fire retardant. Evolution of volatile material was also observed to occur at a lower temperature for the APP foam and it is proposed that the primary degradation of the urethane linkages via a depolycondensation reaction is acid-catalysed by the acidic hydroxyl groups which arise from degradation of APP. The sub-ambient differential distillation trace revealed that the nature and distribution of the volatiles evolved from the APP foam were profoundly different to the standard foam, which confirms that the secondary degradation is also altered in the presence of APP.","title":"Thermal volatilisation analysis of a TDI-based flexible polyurethane foam containing ammonium polyphosphate","authors":"F & K"},"mainTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.1268,0.0056,5.0E-4,0.0011,0.0059,0.1273,0.0687,0.0015,0.001,0.1781,0.008,0.4015,0.0707,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0015,5.0E-4]},{"docId":"197","lemmas":"sensitivity analysis capacity spectrum approach assumption modeling capacity demand representation capacity spectrum assessment method exist determination structural performance building model subject earthquake load repetition analysis earthquake increase intensity result derivation analytical fragility function comparison capacity spectrum assessment approach n2 spo2ida fracas carry highlight advantage limitation approach experimental case study choose evaluate im edp sa sd isdmax estimate obtain capacity spectrum procedure linear time history analysis nltha find approach perform estimate response simple steel frame fracas provide estimate response irregular reinforce concrete frame conclude comparison capacity spectrum approach large scale experiment structure require draw general conclusion","subTopicDistribution":[2.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0412,2.0E-4,0.001,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0753,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,6.0E-4,3.0E-4,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.6366,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0018,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0734,1.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0393,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,8.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.12,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,3.0E-4],"numLemmas":95,"docIndex":197,"docData":{"date":"17\/05\/16","money":"467","university":"B","abstract":"Several capacity spectrum assessment methods exist for determination of structural performance of building models subjected to earthquake loading.

Two experimental case studies have been chosen to evaluate the IM-EDP (Sa-Sd, ISDmax%) estimates obtained from the three different capacity spectrum procedures, as well as from non-linear time-history analyses (NLTHA).

The globular solution conformation of FN was retained following adsorption onto PMA, whereas spontaneous organization of FN into protein (nano) networks occurred on PEA. This distinct distribution of FN at the material interface promoted a different availability, measured via monoclonal antibody binding, of two domains that facilitated integrin binding to FN: FNIII10 (RGD sequence) and FNIII9 (PHSRN synergy sequence). The enhanced exposure of the synergy domain on PEA compared to PMA triggered different focal adhesion assemblies: L929 fibroblasts showed a higher fraction of smaller focal plaques on PMA (40%) than on PEA (20%). Blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies against FNIII10 (HFN7.1) and FNIII9 (mAb1937) confirmed the ability of these polymeric substrates to modulate FN conformation.

We hypothesize that (1) its hearing may function to detect the high-frequency calls of bats, or (2) like its diurnal relatives it may function to detect avian predators, or (3) it may have lost auditory sensitivity as a result of the lack of selective pressures. To test these hypotheses we examined the tuning and sensitivity of the C. eurilochus Vogel\u2019s organ using laser Doppler vibrometry and extracellular neurophysiology. We show that the C. eurilochus ear responds to sound and is most sensitive to frequencies between 1-4 kHz, as confirmed by both the vibration of the tympanal membrane and the physiological response of the associated nerve branches. In comparison to the hearing of its diurnally active relative, Morpho peleides, C. eurilochus has a narrower frequency range with higher auditory thresholds. We conclude that hearing in this butterfly is partially-regressed, and may reflect a trade-off between hearing and vision for survival in low light conditions.","title":"Hearing in the crepuscular owl butterfly (Caligo eurilochus, Nymphalidae)","authors":"L & K & C"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0023,7.0E-4,8.0E-4,0.012,0.0014,0.0186,0.1646,0.0271,4.0E-4,0.0013,0.0397,0.0013,0.0599,0.3249,0.0327,0.0365,0.0531,0.2216,0.0016,8.0E-4]},{"docId":"91","lemmas":"queer youth facebook faith facebook methodology online identity make space queer identify religious youth economic social research council esrc fund project seek shed light youth culture queer community religiosity heterosexuality associate secularism source cast religion automatically negative harmful realisation lesbian gay bisexual transgender lgbt identity explore queer christian youth negotiate sexual religious identity dearth study queer religious youth emerge continue interest role digital technology identity young people base interview lgbt religious young people article examine facebook wider social networking site online environment community engage key concept online embodiment article closer analysis embodiment emotion temporality approach role facebook life queer religious youth explore methodological dilemma evoke presence facebook qualitative research specific group young people","subTopicDistribution":[3.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.0015,7.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,1.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0031,0.1307,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.2023,0.0018,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0118,3.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.0799,1.0E-4,0.1533,0.0066,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0011,0.3868,0.0053,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,7.0E-4,3.0E-4,1.0E-4,4.0E-4,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0028,4.0E-4,2.0E-4,8.0E-4,6.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0026],"numLemmas":113,"docIndex":91,"docData":{"date":"16\/08\/16","money":"783","university":"D","abstract":"\u2018Making space for queer-identifying religious youth\u2019 (2011\u20132013) is an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded project, which seeks to shed light on youth cultures, queer community and religiosity.

Combined with a short summary on relevant aspects of underwater optics, we formulate some topics of future research to overcome current limitations of UWME.","title":"Underwater mixed environments","authors":"F & L & B"},"mainTopicDistribution":[0.0013,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,0.1339,0.046,0.1695,0.0129,0.0019,0.0217,0.001,6.0E-4,9.0E-4,0.161,0.2864,0.002,8.0E-4,0.0471,0.0051,0.1072,9.0E-4]},{"docId":"93","lemmas":"understand pattern process model trophic cascade climate fluctuation human exploitation global change nutrient enrichment terrestrial aquatic ecosystem decline abundance apex predator result trophic cascade profound effect food web lead significant economic societal consequence strength cascade extent disturbance diminish propagate food web vary widely ecosystem formal theory food chain model reproduce cascade effect nature extent dependent formulation show inclusion process represent mathematically density dependent regulation consumer uptake mortality rate generation realistic top cascade simple food chain model realistically model bottom cascade change nutrient input depend inclusion density dependence mortality regulation caricature disease parasite dynamics intra guild predation show conclusion base simple food chain transfer complex marine food web model cascade induce vary river nutrient input fish harvesting rate","subTopicDistribution":[4.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.0137,0.0023,2.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0029,0.0116,2.0E-4,0.0036,5.0E-4,0.0069,0.345,4.0E-4,3.0E-4,5.0E-4,5.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.0064,1.0E-4,0.3317,0.0012,4.0E-4,0.003,0.0015,0.0584,6.0E-4,0.0244,0.0022,6.0E-4,0.0941,0.0015,1.0E-4,7.0E-4,0.0034,1.0E-4,2.0E-4,7.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,2.0E-4,0.0119,5.0E-4,0.0326,3.0E-4,0.0337,4.0E-4],"numLemmas":117,"docIndex":93,"docData":{"date":"18\/08\/16","money":"664","university":"A","abstract":"Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators.

The mirror would be light-weighted as much as possible, i.e. the back surface would be carved away with good thermal stability.  The mechanisms for mirror systems may use methods like minature geared motors, stiction motors and shape memory alloy hinges. The sensoring and directing of the mirror surface will use an image based detection methods. A closed loop control of the mirror position will be used to iterate to a fully aligned system.

As a result of this magnetic compression the electrons acquire a horseshoe distribution function in velocity space. Previous theoretical studies have predicted that this distribution is capable of driving the cyclotron maser instability. To test this theory a scaled laboratory experiment was constructed to replicate this phenomenon in a controlled environment, [3-5] whilst 2D and 3D simulations are also being conducted to predict the experimental radiation power and mode, [6-9]. The experiment operates in the microwave frequency regime and incorporates a region of increasing magnetic field as found at the Earth's pole using magnet solenoids to encase the cylindrical interaction waveguide through which an initially rectilinear electron beam (12A) was accelerated by a 75keV pulse. Experimental results showed evidence of the formation of the horseshoe distribution function.

Here, immune responses induced by combinations of the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) and the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), which causes a murine hookworm infection and an experimental porin protein vaccine against STm, were examined. Mice infected with both STm and Nb induced similar numbers of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes compared with singly infected mice, as determined by flow cytometry, although lower levels of secreted Th2, but not Th1 cytokines were detected by ELISA after re-stimulation of splenocytes. Furthermore, the density of FoxP3+ T cells in the T zone of co-infected mice was lower compared to mice that only received Nb, but was greater than those that received STm. This reflected the intermediate levels of IL-10 detected from splenocytes. Co-infection compromised clearance of both pathogens, with worms still detectable in mice weeks after they were cleared in the control group. Despite altered control of bacterial and helminth colonization in co-infected mice, robust extrafollicular Th1 and Th2-reflecting immunoglobulin-switching profiles were detected, with IgG2a, IgG1 and IgE plasma cells all detected in parallel. Whilst extrafollicular antibody responses were maintained in the first weeks after co-infection, the GC response was less than that in mice infected with Nb only. Nb infection resulted in some abrogation of the longer-term development of anti-STm IgG responses. This suggested that prior Nb infection may modulate the induction of protective antibody responses to vaccination. To assess this we immunized mice with porins, which confer protection in an antibody-dependent manner, before challenging with STm. Mice that had resolved a Nb infection prior to immunization induced less anti-porin IgG and had compromised protection against infection.

In exploring this ethical debate, I draw on a case study from Australia of a student excluded from mainstream education on the basis that inclusion will not serve the greater good of the majority of students. My intention here is not to offer practical guidance in the complex day-to-day deliberations of educators dealing with issues of inclusion, but to elaborate the structure of the present thinking about inclusion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the deeper basis of ethical reasoning will itself lead to a greater recognition of the need for exploring the ethical grounds of teaching and learning. I will argue that any dichotomy between the utilitarian happiness of the many and the deontological commitment to the rights of the individual is based on a misconception of human identity. The false choice between the many and the one rests upon the assumption that morality is fundamentally about restricting personal preferences in favour of the good of the majority, that there exists a fundamental conflict between what is good for the individual and what is good for society as a whole. This will lead me to argue that we need to reinterpret human identity as constituted by its social relations and that this reorientation is best achieved by reference to virtue ethics.","title":"What's the use of ethical philosophy? the role of ethical theory in special educational needs","authors":"E & A"},"mainTopicDistribution":[5.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,3.0E-4,0.1743,0.3515,7.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,4.0E-4,5.0E-4,4.0E-4,0.2573,0.2064,7.0E-4,0.002,5.0E-4,0.0012,0.0022,6.0E-4]}]}
