Agency theory has dominated franchise research. A more rounded theoretical interpretation of the franchising relationship is offered by employing both agency theory and institutional theory perspectives.\nDesign\/methodology\/approach: Adopts an interpretive approach, employing in-depth interviews with franchisors and franchisees in nine franchise organisations operating in the retail sector in China. Contributes a fuller understanding of how to manage the research process in China.\nFindings: Reveals how the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict are manifest in the franchise relationship in China. The explanatory power of agency theory is apparent when viewed in terms of the vertical agency problem. However, free riding outside the franchise system, in the form of counterfeiting, mitigates against the occurrence of free riding within it. With regard to institutional theory, we demonstrate that the regulatory institutional pillar is a crucial foundation for the franchise relationship.\nPractical implications: Offers insights for franchisors and franchisees considering franchise relationships in China.\nOriginality\/value: For the first time in the literature, we offer insights into key elements of the franchise relationship in China. Employing both agency theory and institutional theory facilitates a rounded explanation of the developing franchise environment in China.","title":"The franchise relationship in China: agency and institutional theory perspectives","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"574","weight":0.4371,"docData":{"date":"21\/06\/15","money":"254","wordCount":"153","university":"E","abstract":"This paper investigates the use of a pilot signal in reducing the electrical peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) intensitymodulated optical wireless communication system. The phase of\nthe pilot signal is chosen based on the selected mapping (SLM) algorithm while the maximum likelihood criterion is used to estimate the pilot signal at the receiver. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the pilot-assisted optical OFDM system is identical to that of the basic optical OFDM (with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented) at the desired BER of less than 10−3 needed to establish a reliable communication link. The pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique results in higher reduction in PAPR for high order (M >4) constellations than the classical SLM. With respect to a basic OFDM system, with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented, a pilot-assisted M-QAM optical OFDM system is capable of reducing the electrical PAPR by over about 2.5 dB at a modest complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) point of 10−4 forM = 64. Greater reductions in PAPR are possible at lower values of CCDF with no degradation to the system\u2019s error performance. Clipping the time domain signal at both ends mildly (at 25 times the signal variance level) results in a PAPR reduction of about 6.3 dB at the same CCDF of 10−4 but with an error floor of about 3 × 10−5 . Although it is possible to attain any desired level of electrical PAPR reduction with signal clipping, this will be at a cost of deterioration in the systems\u2019s bit error performance.","title":"Pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique for optical OFDM communication systems","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"356","weight":0.3884,"docData":{"date":"08\/01\/16","money":"857","wordCount":"114","university":"B","abstract":"Objective\n\nAmniotic membrane (AM) is used to manage various debilitated ocular surface conditions. The impact of oxidative stress and free radicals on the ocular surface is increasingly being recognized. Hyaluronic acid (HA) has anti-inflammatory properties and is abundantly present in AM. In this in vitro pilot study, we investigated the potential of AM for intrinsic free radical scavenging properties.\nMethods\n\nStrips of AM were incubated in sealed tubes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After being sonicated, uptake of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide\/Peroxidase assay. For comparison, 1630 kDA HA was used.\nResults\nThere was uptake of ROS by all AM samples, which decreased with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Mean ROS uptake for 5 different AMs at 1 hour was significantly greater for 50 μM (83%; SD 11.7, SEM 5.23) compared with 100 μM (67%; SD 20.48, SEM 9.16; p = 0.028; 95% CI 2.8-29.2). The HA comparison group showed similar uptake and trend. \nConclusion\nThis pilot study demonstrates that AM is able to remove ROS from its environment. Demonstrating total antioxidant capacity in AM provides evidence for use as a free radical scavenger. The antioxidant properties of AM and the contribution from HA require more research.","title":"Antioxidant properties of amniotic membrane: novel observations from a pilot study","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"530","weight":0.3098,"docData":{"date":"11\/09\/19","money":"771","wordCount":"114","university":"B","abstract":"For the sake of gaining competitive advantages, it is important to evaluate the satisfaction level of a product or service from the users' perspective. This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"576","weight":0.1982,"docData":{"date":"27\/01\/17","money":"488","wordCount":"106","university":"B","abstract":"Several studies have been conducted by environmental psychologists on worker satisfaction from office spaces with the attempt to relate it to human productivity and profit.

Results revealed that around half of the respondents were satisfied with the indoor environment of their offices. Presence of a window and access to daylighting are seen to contribute highly towards satisfaction. Most dissatisfaction expressed was less on account of actual physical conditions and related more to the poor ability of users to control the environmental conditions like temperature, lighting, ventilation and humidity.

We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.","title":"Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"226","weight":0.3824,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/15","money":"583","wordCount":"34","university":"D","abstract":"The rapid accumulation of particles suspended in a thermocapillary liquid bridge is planned to be investigated during the JEREMI experiment on the International Space Station scheduled for 2016.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"598","weight":0.1429,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/15","money":"925","wordCount":"56","university":"D","abstract":"A Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) crystal has been used in conjunction with a 10-ps pulsed laser to produce a frequency-doubled conically-refracted Gaussian beam.

Deriving and solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with fermions.","title":"Light scattering and dissipative dynamics of many fermionic atoms in an optical lattice","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"481","weight":0.0863,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/18","money":"250","wordCount":"72","university":"B","abstract":"Geochemical and isotopic data acquired pre-, syn- And post- CO2 injection at the Pembina Cardium CO2 Monitoring Pilot in Alberta, Canada is presented.

In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"723","weight":0.0589,"docData":{"date":"30\/08\/16","money":"717","wordCount":"124","university":"C","abstract":"Two-dimensional metasurface structures have recently been proposed to reduce the challenges of fabrication of traditional plasmonic metamaterials. However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles.

Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a \u2018synthesized split photodiode\u2019 detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"428","weight":0.0087,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/16","money":"136","wordCount":"115","university":"E","abstract":"We show that arrays of emissive nanorod structures can exhibit strong photonic crystal behavior, via observations of the far-field luminescence from core-shell and quantum disc InGaN\/GaN nanorods. The conditions needed for the formation of directional Bloch modes characteristic of strong photonic behavior are found to depend critically upon the vertical shape of the nanorod sidewalls. Index guiding by a region of lower volume-averaged refractive index near the base of the nanorods creates a quasi-suspended photonic crystal slab at the top of the nanorods which supports Bloch modes. Only diffractive behavior could be observed without this region. Slab waveguide modelling of the vertical structure shows that the behavioral regime of the emissive nanorod arrays depends strongly upon the optical coupling between the nanorod region and the planar layers below. The controlled crossover between the two regimes of photonic crystal operation enables the design of photonic nanorod structures formed on planar substrates that exploit either behavior depending on device requirements.","title":"Strong photonic crystal behavior in regular arrays of core-shell and quantum disc InGaN\/GaN nanorod light-emitting diodes","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"190","weight":0.0087,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/19","money":"820","wordCount":"116","university":"B","abstract":"Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are expected to play a critical role in future energy grids.

To investigate its importance in P. falciparum, we generated a pepc null mutant (D10Δpepc), which was only achievable when malate, a reduction product of oxaloacetate, was added to the growth medium. D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels. In contrast, metabolism of the carbon skeleton of 13C,15N-U-glutamine was similar in both parasite lines, although the flux was lower in D10Δpepc; it also confirmed the operation of a complete forward TCA cycle in the wild type parasite. Overall, these data confirm the CO2 fixing activity of PEPC and suggest that it provides metabolites essential for TCA cycle anaplerosis and the maintenance of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance.

The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"200","weight":0.5193,"docData":{"date":"06\/11\/18","money":"938","wordCount":"105","university":"A","abstract":"The fuel consumption of a ship is strongly influenced by her frictional resistance, which is directly affected by the roughness of the hull׳s surface.

This paper proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model which enables the prediction of the effect of antifouling coatings on frictional resistance. It also outlines details of CFD simulations of resistance tests on coated plates in a towing tank. Initially, roughness functions and roughness Reynolds numbers for several antifouling coatings were evaluated using an indirect method. Following this, the most suitable roughness function model for the coatings was employed in the wall-function of the CFD software. CFD simulations of towing tests were then performed and the results were validated against the experimental data given in the literature. Finally, the effects of antifouling coatings on the frictional resistance of a tanker were predicted using the validated CFD model.","title":"A CFD model for the frictional resistance prediction of antifouling coatings","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"187","weight":0.5087,"docData":{"date":"12\/07\/19","money":"252","wordCount":"116","university":"C","abstract":"Statistical models used to estimate the spatio-temporal pattern in disease risk from areal unit data often represent the risk surface for each time period in terms of known covariates and a set of spatially smooth random effects.

This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify step changes is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy.

To overcome such drawbacks, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, a severe bottleneck is how to compute the PCA covariance matrix efficiently and avoid computational difficulties, especially when the spatial dimension of the hypercube is large. In this paper, structured covariance PCA (SC-PCA) is proposed for fast computation of the covariance matrix. In line with how spectral data is acquired in either the push-broom or tunable filter way, different implementation schemes of SC-PCA are presented. As the proposed SC-PCA can determine the covariance matrix from partial covariance matrices in parallel even without deducting the mean vector in prior, it facilitates real-time data analysis whilst the hypercube is acquired. This has significantly reduced the scale of required memory and also allows efficient onsite feature extraction and data reduction to benefit subsequent tasks in coding\/compression, transmission, and analytics of hyperspectral data.","title":"Structured covariance principal component analysis for real-time onsite feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"433","weight":0.025,"docData":{"date":"29\/06\/19","money":"428","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Offshore wind power is becoming an important topic of the world's renewable energy research.

Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after.

The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered.

Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the last 6 quarters. In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter.

First, the linearised Boltzmann equation is solved for Poiseuille and thermal creep flows, where the influence of different molecular models on the mass and heat flow rates is assessed, and the Onsager-Casimir relation at the microscopic level for large Knudsen numbers is demonstrated. Recent experimental measurements of mass flow rates along a rectangular tube with large aspect ratio are compared with numerical results for the linearised Boltzmann equation. Then, a number of two-dimensional micro flows in the transition and free molecular flow regimes are simulated using the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. The influence of the molecular model is discussed, as well as the applicability of the linearised Boltzmann equation. For thermally driven flows in the free molecular regime, it is found that the magnitudes of the flow velocity are inversely proportional to the Knudsen number. The streamline patterns of thermal creep flow inside a closed\nrectangular channel are analysed in detail: when the Knudsen number is smaller than a critical value, the flow pattern can be predicted based on a linear superposition of the velocity profiles of linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep \nflows between parallel plates. For large Knudsen numbers, the flow pattern can be determined using the linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep velocity profiles at the critical Knudsen number. The critical Knudsen number is found to be related to the aspect ratio of the rectangular channel.","title":"Solving the Boltzmann equation deterministically by the fast spectral method: application to gas microflows","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"484","weight":0.6364,"docData":{"date":"18\/11\/15","money":"511","wordCount":"11","university":"E","abstract":"null","title":"Flow of power law fluids in microfluidic bifurcating networks designed using biomimetic principles","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"754","weight":0.5846,"docData":{"date":"29\/09\/18","money":"547","wordCount":"147","university":"E","abstract":"Many artificial and natural fluids contain macromolecules, particles or droplets that impart complex flow behavior to the fluid.

Due to the need for accurate dosimetry of small field size VHEE beams we have performed dose measurements using EBT2 Gafchromic® film. Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response. Neutron and proton contribution to the equivalent doses are negligible for VHEE. The study demonstrates that EBT2 Gafchromic film is a reliable dosimeter that can be used for dosimetry of VHEE. The results indicate an energy-independent response of the dosimeter for 20 MeV and 165 MeV electron beams and has been found to be suitable for dosimetry of VHEE.","title":"Dosimetry of very high energy electrons (VHEE) for radiotherapy applications: using radiochromic film measurements and Monte Carlo simulations","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"497","weight":0.2831,"docData":{"date":"07\/07\/17","money":"529","wordCount":"107","university":"B","abstract":"We combine two scanning electron microscopy techniques to investigate the influence of dislocations on the light emission from nitride semiconductors.

In this study using 223 metabolite standards, we explored the retention mechanisms on three zwitterionic columns with varied mobile phase composition, demonstrated the interference from poor chromatographic peak shapes on the output of data extraction, and assessed the quality of chromatographic signals and the separation of isomers under each LC condition. As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column. Using extracts from the protozoan parasite Leishmania, we compared the numbers of repeatedly detected LC-HRMS features under different LC conditions with putative identification of metabolites not amongst the standards being based on accurate mass (±3ppm). Besides column chemistry, the pH of the mobile phase plays a key role in not only determining the retention mechanisms of solutes but also the output of the LC-HRMS data processing. Fast evaporation of ammonium carbonate produced less ion suppression in ESI source and consequently improved the detectability of the metabolites in low abundance in comparison with other ammonium salts. Our results show that the combination of a ZIC-pHILIC column with an ammonium carbonate mobile phase, pH 9.2, at 20mM in the aqueous phase or 10mM in both aqueous and organic mobile phase components, provided the most suitable LC conditions for LC-HRMS-based untargeted metabolite profiling of Leishmania parasite extracts.

We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"672","weight":0.2894,"docData":{"date":"29\/09\/18","money":"170","wordCount":"159","university":"E","abstract":"Anthropogenic climate change is likely to significantly increase human exposure to droughts and floods. It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","title":"Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"449","weight":0.2778,"docData":{"date":"01\/02\/18","money":"337","wordCount":"90","university":"C","abstract":"Multilateral funding for global environmental protection, such as biodiversity conservation, requires donor participation. When are donors willing to participate? We examine a game-theoretic model of multilateral funding for environmental projects in developing countries. Donors must first decide whether to participate in a multilateral institution. They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows. These findings can illuminate bargaining over multilateral climate finance and inform the design of international institutions.","title":"Does it pay to play?

These variables come in the form of an estimate along with a standard error reflecting the uncertainty of this estimate. Existing empirical work simply uses the estimates as an explanatory variable and discards the information provided by the standard errors. In this paper, we argue that the appropriate practice should be to take into account the uncertainty around the WGI estimates through the use of multiple imputation. We investigate the importance of our proposed approach by revisiting in three applications the results of recently published studies. These applications cover the impact of governance on (i) capital flows; (ii) international trade; (iii) income levels around the world. We generally find that the estimated effects of governance are highly sensitive to the use of multiple imputation. We also show that model misspecification is a concern for the results of our reference studies. We conclude that the effects of governance are hard to establish once we take into account uncertainty around both the WGI estimates and the correct model specification.","title":"The Known Unknowns of Governance","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"608","weight":0.18,"docData":{"date":"12\/09\/16","money":"910","wordCount":"52","university":"E","abstract":"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a reliable neuropsychological assessment, but major barriers are still encountered when such tests are used across cultures and during the lifespan.

Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments.

We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks.

Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA\u2019s and crews\u2019 utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a \u2018distributed discourse\u2019 and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions\u2019 ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA\u2019s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.","title":"Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"86","weight":0.2821,"docData":{"date":"12\/07\/17","money":"481","wordCount":"39","university":"D","abstract":"In this Commentary, Professor Andrew Goudie of the University of Strathclyde reflects on the economic cases presented in the Commentary by the pro-union and pro-independence campaigns (by John Swinney MSP and Professor Jim Gallagher) and on the wider economic (and political) debate within which the current economic issues surrounding the Union, Independence and, importantly, enhanced devolution, have - and have not - been debated.","title":"Editorial introduction [June 2014]","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"735","weight":0.221,"docData":{"date":"29\/02\/16","money":"830","wordCount":"86","university":"A","abstract":"Using evidence from a participatory action research process with over 100 asylum seekers and refugees in Scotland, this study explores participants\u2019 views on mental health problems, stigma and discrimination.

The Scottish Covenanters\u2019 alliance with the English Parliamentarians was formalised by the Solemn League and Covenant which again sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy throughout the three Stuart kingdoms.

Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their \u2018feet on the ground\u2019 where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for \u2018generation bagging\u2019  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.

Despite the often \u2018cottage industry\u2019 nature of many ancestral attractions (often reliant on volunteers and local \u2018good will) the outcome of the visit can often be greater satisfaction and a strong repeat visitation pattern.","title":"Connecting with the past: meeting the needs of ancestral tourists in Scotland","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"608","weight":0.06,"docData":{"date":"12\/09\/16","money":"910","wordCount":"52","university":"E","abstract":"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a reliable neuropsychological assessment, but major barriers are still encountered when such tests are used across cultures and during the lifespan.

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the motor points of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.  Low frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants.

Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of <1.7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (<1.7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3.1 cm.

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","title":"Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective","authors":"F & L & B"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":10.0,"label":"asylum"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"employment"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"advice"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"action"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"research"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"experience"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"refugee"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"participant"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"include"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"justice"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"crew"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"citizen"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"dispute"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"university"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"seek"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"union"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"journal"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"british"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"claim"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"publish"}],"topicIndex":94,"mainTopicIds":["5","18","10"]},{"topicId":"95","topDocs":[{"docId":"207","weight":0.6782,"docData":{"date":"03\/05\/18","money":"176","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"Mooring systems are essential to the floating structures including offshore platforms, wave energy converters and floating breakwaters.

A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations. Example applications of this lightweight shape changing structure include concentrators, mirrors, and communications antennas that are able to dynamically change their focal point, as well as substructures for solar sails that are capable of steering through solar winds by altering the sails׳ subjected area.","title":"Inflatable shape changing colonies assembling versatile smart space structures","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"761","weight":0.161,"docData":{"date":"17\/07\/16","money":"313","wordCount":"88","university":"D","abstract":"Asymmetry in the collective dynamics of ponderomotively-driven electrons in the interaction of an ultraintense laser pulse with a relativistically transparent target is demonstrated experimentally.

The temporally-resolved dynamics of the interaction are investigated via particle-in-cell simulations.

Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained for this Phase I clinical study. Patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to conventional therapy were recruited and given L-NNA intravenously at two different dose levels. Volumetric perfusion CT scans were carried out at 1, 24, 48 & 72 hours post L-NNA. Blood pressures were taken at regular interval for 6 hours after LNNA. L-NNA was well tolerated by the four patients who received it. Blood flow (BF) and blood vo-lume (BV) in both tumour and kidney were reduced post L-NNA administration (renal BF\u201420%; renal BV\u2014 19.7%; tumour BF\u201416.9%; tumour BV\u201418.6%), though the effect was more sustained in tumour vasculature. A negative correlation was found between the change in systemic blood pressure and vascular supply to the tu-mour within 1 hour following L-NNA (p < 0.0001).

The differential effect of L-NNA on tumour and renal blood flow, and the absence of any significant toxicity in this small cohort of patients permit further dose escalation of L-NNA in future early phase trials. The predictive value of blood pressure change in relation to the acute effect of L-NNA on tumour vasculature deserves further evaluation.","title":"The acute physiological effects of the vaso-active drug, L-NNA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, on renal and tumour perfusion in human subjects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"581","weight":0.1058,"docData":{"date":"20\/06\/18","money":"811","wordCount":"105","university":"D","abstract":"Water quality models are increasingly being used routinely to help ascertain the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems for design and operational management purposes.

The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory.

The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.","title":"An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"342","weight":0.0304,"docData":{"date":"06\/07\/18","money":"195","wordCount":"101","university":"B","abstract":"The ever increasing volume of referrals from primary care to specialist services is putting considerable pressure on resource-constrained health services while effective communication across fragmented services remains a substantial challenge.

Traditional investment analysis methods are considered marginally useful to analyse this case. Instead, the recent tools of time-dependent investment analysis are more appropriate, since they are not inherently restricted to immediate, irreversible decisions. In the present work, a time-dependent computational model is presented and applied in the case study of the Greek Power Sector, in order to estimate the potential advantages of the fuel switching concept. Moreover, the optimal timing of switching is derived, to ensure increasing yields of an average-capacity power-plant.

The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":21.0,"label":"structure"},{"weight":19.0,"label":"change"},{"weight":18.0,"label":"pressure"},{"weight":16.0,"label":"response"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"mooring"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"dynamics"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"float"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"valve"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"system"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"platform"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"volume"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"mass"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"stiffness"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"flow"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"axis"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"motion"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"frequency"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"line"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"influence"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"optimal"}],"topicIndex":95,"mainTopicIds":["13","11","0"]},{"topicId":"96","topDocs":[{"docId":"728","weight":0.6742,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/18","money":"876","wordCount":"89","university":"E","abstract":"This study explores the use of online newsgroups and discussion groups by people in situations of information poverty.

Two layers of \u2018live\u2019 are conceived; the first is an approach that aims to bring the built environment into the classroom, while the second utilises the built environment as an open textbook. Categorized under these two layers, the exercises place emphasis on critical reflection, interaction with behavioural phenomena, contemplating settings and systematic observations, behavioural mapping and active engagement.

The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that \u2018the making of Muslims\u2019 is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider \u2018decentring\u2019 of the West.

Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010).

The study draws on artefacts, interviews and videos created by and around Rancid to identify and analyse this example of marginal, alternative entrepreneurship.

Rancid\u2019s entrepreneurial story is depicted as cycles, not just a linear journey, but following more complicated paths \u2013 from periphery to centre, and back again; returning to roots, whilst trying to move forwards too; grounded in tradition but also radically focused on dramatic change.

Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"68","weight":0.0569,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/15","money":"515","wordCount":"90","university":"E","abstract":"At present High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Voltage Source Converters (VSC) are susceptible dc faults leading to extreme currents.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

Conﬁrming previous research [1], it has been found that airborne LiDAR data, when combined with hyperspectral data, can improve classiﬁcation results. The novelty of this study is in the quantiﬁcation of the contribution of the individual data sources and their derived parameters. LiDAR information was combined with the hyperspectral image in a data fusion approach. Different data fusion techniques were tested, including feature and decision fusion. Decision fucsion produced optimal results, reaching an overall accuracy of 96% (Kappa [3] of 0:95).","title":"Tree species mapping by combining hyperspectral with LiDAR data","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"27","weight":0.3133,"docData":{"date":"20\/09\/16","money":"750","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"The 2013 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Data Fusion Technical Committee (DFTC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society aimed at investigating the synergistic use of hyperspectral and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data.

Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.\nMaterial and Methods\nTwo embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.\nResults\nStatistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p\u200A=\u200A<0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC\u200A=\u200A0.851). Sensitivity and specificity for tissue identification was 77% and 70% respectively to a resolution of 6 mm2.\nConclusions\nThis cadaveric study has evaluated the ability of our elasticity assessment device to differentiate bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter to a resolution of 6 mm2. The results provide useful data for which to continue to examine the use of elasticity assessment devices for tissue quality assessment with the aim of giving haptic feedback to surgeons performing complex surgery.","title":"Tissue quality assessment using a novel direct elasticity assessment device (the e-finger): a cadaveric study of prostatectomy dissection","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"436","weight":0.0511,"docData":{"date":"03\/05\/19","money":"804","wordCount":"101","university":"A","abstract":"A method to grow high quality, single crystalline semiconductor material irrespective of the substrate would allow a cost-effective improvement to functionality and performance of optoelectronic devices.

To investigate its importance in P. falciparum, we generated a pepc null mutant (D10Δpepc), which was only achievable when malate, a reduction product of oxaloacetate, was added to the growth medium. D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels. In contrast, metabolism of the carbon skeleton of 13C,15N-U-glutamine was similar in both parasite lines, although the flux was lower in D10Δpepc; it also confirmed the operation of a complete forward TCA cycle in the wild type parasite. Overall, these data confirm the CO2 fixing activity of PEPC and suggest that it provides metabolites essential for TCA cycle anaplerosis and the maintenance of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. \nTo address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. \nThe SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper. Compared with the existing process, the new process is significantly streamlined, and permits an IED-independent system configuration tool to carry out the entire configuration process. No proprietary software or communications are needed. It also allows the protection settings to be performed at a system level, rather than individually on a \u201Cper device\u201D basis. \nThe key challenges that must be addressed in order for the proposed process to be widely adopted are: the IEC 61850 data model for protection settings is not complete; vendors may prefer to maintain proprietary formats; the data model should have the capability to be extended for future protection functions. This paper reports the progress towards addressing these challenges.","title":"Improving IEC 61850 interoperability and simplifying IED configuration through the standardisation of protection settings","authors":"A & G"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":13.0,"label":"class"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"fusion"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"permutation"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"lidar"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"growth"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"point"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"order"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"grid"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"fix"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"tree"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"geometric"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"map"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"pattern"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"give"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"involution"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"interval"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"set"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"rate"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"entire"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"label"}],"topicIndex":97,"mainTopicIds":["9","0","16"]},{"topicId":"10","topDocs":[{"docId":"334","weight":0.5697,"docData":{"date":"16\/03\/15","money":"298","wordCount":"80","university":"E","abstract":"Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), constitutes the demands that teachers are supposed to meet.

The argument is advanced that if there is a parliamentary crisis, or a series of interconnected crises, then it might well be that what the UK is witnessing is a conceptual crisis: a crisis that stems from the counter-positioning of established notions of representative democracy and legitimacy derived from electoral processes against countervailing conceptions of governance, democratic representation and representative claims which are not focused upon, or do not privilege, the institutional form of parliament or electoral representation.","title":"A crisis of parliament","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"510","weight":0.4471,"docData":{"date":"25\/08\/19","money":"388","wordCount":"85","university":"C","abstract":"In this article, Meer tentatively delineates three ways in which he understands that the concept of Islamophobia is being informed by postcolonial scholarship. The first functions as continuity, in so far as it is claimed that historical colonial dynamics are reproduced in contemporary postcolonial environments, broadly conceived. The second involves translation. This is related to the first but different in that it focuses in particular on the utility of Orientalist critique for the concept of Islamophobia. The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that \u2018the making of Muslims\u2019 is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider \u2018decentring\u2019 of the West.

This is because it expresses a story of how Muslims have contested and sought revisions to existing citizenship settlements, not least the ways in which approaches to anti-discrimination are configured. This is a story that is observable within imperfect liberal democratic frameworks that contain some institutional levers through which to challenge Islamophobia.","title":"Islamophobia and postcolonialism: continuity, Orientalism and Muslim consciousness","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"657","weight":0.4231,"docData":{"date":"18\/06\/19","money":"248","wordCount":"26","university":"B","abstract":"\u201CPast violence is the best predictor of future violence\u201D \u2013 How many times have you encountered or indeed used this statement in your own practice?

The Punk Rock band Rancid has a 20-year history of successfully creating independent musical and related creative enterprises from the margins of the music industry. The study draws on artefacts, interviews and videos created by and around Rancid to identify and analyse this example of marginal, alternative entrepreneurship. A three-part analytic frame was applied to analysing these artefacts. Place is critical to Rancid\u2019s enterprise, grounding the band socially, culturally, geographically and politically. Practice also plays an important role with Rancid\u2019s activities encompassing labour, making music, movement and human interactions. The third, and most prevalent, dimension of alterity is that of power which includes data related to dominance, subordination, exclusion, control and liberation. Rancid\u2019s entrepreneurial story is depicted as cycles, not just a linear journey, but following more complicated paths \u2013 from periphery to centre, and back again; returning to roots, whilst trying to move forwards too; grounded in tradition but also radically focused on dramatic change.

Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010).

As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation\u2019s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences. This paper focuses on divergent representations of Rwandan monarchical figures \u2013 often unnamed \u2013 whom the narrators imbue with values according to their individual political affiliations, lived experiences, and identity. These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.","title":"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"774","weight":0.0541,"docData":{"date":"21\/12\/15","money":"857","wordCount":"37","university":"E","abstract":"Undertakes a comparative evaluation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 to assess the veracity of claims that the Scottish freedom of information regime guarantees greater rights for applicants than the system operating in England and Wales.","title":"An evaluation of the United Kingdom and Scottish freedom of information regimes: comparative law and real-world practice","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"611","weight":0.0536,"docData":{"date":"15\/10\/15","money":"185","wordCount":"58","university":"D","abstract":"The directive 2011\/36\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5th April 2011) defines trafficking as \u201Cthe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"132","weight":0.0237,"docData":{"date":"05\/10\/16","money":"408","wordCount":"127","university":"D","abstract":"An increasingly dominant neo-abolitionist perspective on the issue of prostitution is currently taking hold across Europe.

When are donors willing to participate? We examine a game-theoretic model of multilateral funding for environmental projects in developing countries. Donors must first decide whether to participate in a multilateral institution. They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined.

Reflecting its anti-inflammatory actions, we have previously reported that ES-62 protects mice from developing Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA): thus, as this helminth-derived product may exhibit therapeutic potential in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is important to understand the protective immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by ES-62 in this model in vivo. We have established to date that ES-62 acts by downregulating pathogenic Th17\/IL-17-mediated responses and upregulating the regulatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, our studies have identified that IL-22, another member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, exerts dual pathogenic and protective roles in this model of RA with ES-62 harnessing the cytokine's inflammation-resolving and tissue repair properties in the joint during the established phase of disease. Here, we discuss the counter-regulatory roles of IL-22 in the murine model of CIA and present additional novel data showing that ES-62 selectively induces γδ T cells with the capacity to induce IL-22 production and that γδ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-22, but not IL-17, induced during CIA can be identified by their expression of TLR4. Moreover, we also show that treatment of mice undergoing CIA with the active PC moiety of ES-62, in the form of PC conjugated to BSA, is not only sufficient to mimic the ES-62-dependent suppression of pathogenic IL-17 responses shown previously but also that of the IL-22 and IL-10 up-regulation observed with the parasitic worm product during CIA. These findings not only reinforce the potential of IL-22, firstly described as a Th17-related pro-inflammatory cytokine, as a protective factor in arthritis but also suggest that drugs based on the PC moiety found in ES-62 may be able to harness the joint-protecting activities of IL-22 therapeutically.","title":"The parasitic worm product ES-62 up-regulates IL-22 production by γδ T cells in the murine model of collagen-induced arthritis","authors":"F & K"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":12.0,"label":"entrepreneurship"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"crisis"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"scholarship"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"intraparty"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"feminist"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"progressive"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"party"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"parliament"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"representation"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"politics"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"contemporary"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"narrative"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"rancid"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"islamophobia"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"parliamentary"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"claim"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"violence"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"muslim"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"electoral"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"gendered"}],"topicIndex":98,"mainTopicIds":["1","4","0"]},{"topicId":"11","topDocs":[{"docId":"169","weight":0.4927,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/17","money":"377","wordCount":"137","university":"A","abstract":"The thermal protection system is a key element in atmospheric re-entry missions of aerospace vehicles.

The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality plays a key role in the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4.

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.","title":"Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.0531,"docData":{"date":"23\/02\/15","money":"285","wordCount":"147","university":"C","abstract":"Biased agonism describes a multi-state model of G protein-coupled receptor activation in which each ligand induces a unique structural conformation of the receptor, such that the receptor couples differentially to G proteins and other intracellular proteins. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by endogenous nucleotides, such as ATP and UTP. A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"216","weight":0.0236,"docData":{"date":"12\/09\/17","money":"241","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"This document reports on an Institutional Learning Process that has critically analysed the impact and effectiveness of Terre des hommes' (Tdh) engagement in Albania over the last 14 years.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"312","weight":0.0054,"docData":{"date":"22\/12\/17","money":"372","wordCount":"189","university":"E","abstract":"The focus is on the protracted dispute (2009 - 2011) between British Airways (BA) and its cabin crew and their union BASSA (British Airlines\u2019 Stewards and Stewardesses Association). Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company\u2019s imposition, in disregard of collective bargaining procedures, of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new \u2018mixed fleet\u2019 on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a \u2018strategy of decapitation\u2019 of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA\u2019s and crews\u2019 utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a \u2018distributed discourse\u2019 and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions\u2019 ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA\u2019s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.","title":"Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment","authors":"D"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":14.0,"label":"cavity"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"particle"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"thermal"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"vehicle"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"heat"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"length"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"surface"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"ratio"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"protection"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"triad"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"vcpr"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"wall"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"depth"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"observe"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"aerospace"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"regime"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"vertical"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"oligothiophene"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"unit"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"characterise"}],"topicIndex":11,"mainTopicIds":["11","14","7"]},{"topicId":"99","topDocs":[{"docId":"268","weight":0.5699,"docData":{"date":"09\/01\/16","money":"616","wordCount":"93","university":"E","abstract":"The contribution of this study is an increased understanding of personal creativity and the innovation process in haute cuisine, a validation of the sociocultural systems view of creativity and a model that accounts for the sociocultural dimensions of haute cuisine.

There were many innovations in the field of agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850s and 1860s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the steam plough, with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870s and 1880s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the steam plough in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to have a major impact on rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler\u2019s steam\nplough.What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure.\nThe environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible. This article will interrogate why, despite its essential unfeasibility, the project was pursued, and will argue that the momentum created by the dynamic between the three networks involved propelled it forward despite growing evidence of failure.\nThis article therefore uses an inductive approach by examining a particular example of agricultural design innovation and analysing the pertinent social issues in what would have been termed by contemporaries \u2018entrepreneurial spirit\u2019.","title":"The role of social networks in agricultural innovation: the Sutherland reclamations and the Fowler steam plough, c.1855-c.1885","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"163","weight":0.2616,"docData":{"date":"17\/04\/16","money":"665","wordCount":"65","university":"C","abstract":"The mechanistic worldview that has determined nature as a machine composed of related but discrete components helps to support the commonly held idea that humans are at the pinnacle of creation, the source of all value, the measure of all things.

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx\u2019s work on fictitious capital.

According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value \u2013 only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession\u2019s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.

A narrow view of the process, one focused on short-term revenue maximisation principles, is inadequate due to secondary system elements that can impact technology commercialisation outcomes.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"230","weight":0.1064,"docData":{"date":"06\/01\/18","money":"434","wordCount":"142","university":"C","abstract":"The first computer-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) was performed in 1997.

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes. Further concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders are required to fully integrate preoperative assessment within the health-board surgical care pathway. A substantial \u2013 yet unfulfilled \u2013 potential benefit in embedding information technology in routine use within the preoperative clinic would be to improve the reporting of surgical outcomes.","title":"A study of clinical and information management processes in the surgical pre-assessment clinic","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"21","weight":0.0506,"docData":{"date":"13\/03\/16","money":"969","wordCount":"102","university":"B","abstract":"Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a more attractive transportation option, as they offer great cost savings, decrease foreign oil dependency, and reduce carbon emissions. However, varying temporal and spatial demand patterns of EVs threatens power grid operations and its physical components. Thus, the ability of the power grid to handle the potential extra load has become a major factor in the mainstream success. In order for this integration to occur seamlessly, the power grid and the consumers need to be coordinated in harmony. In this paper, we address the critical challenges introduced by the penetration of EVs, systematically categorize the proposed frameworks for demand management, and the role of information and communication technologies in the solution process. We provide a comprehensive survey on the communication requirements, the standards and the candidate technologies towards the Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV).

Previous work demonstrated this process to be highly effective across a wide range of contaminants and soil conditions at the bench scale. In this work, a suite of 12 experiments explored the effectiveness of the process as operating scale was increased 1000-fold from the bench (0.003 m3 ) to intermediate (0.3 m3 ) and pilot field-scale (3 m3 ) with coal tar and petrochemical NAPLs. As scale increased, remediation efficiency of 97\u201399.95% was maintained. Smoul- dering propagation velocities of 0.6\u201314 × 10−5 m\/s at Darcy air fluxes of 1.54\u20139.15 cm\/s were consistent with observations in previous bench studies, as was the dependence on air flux. The pilot field-scale experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000mg\/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with increasing scale. Once the threshold was exceeded, basic process characteristics of average peak temperature, destructive efficiency, and treatment velocity were relatively independent of scale.","title":"Volumetric scale-up of smouldering remediation of contaminated materials","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"618","weight":0.0351,"docData":{"date":"04\/09\/18","money":"838","wordCount":"57","university":"B","abstract":"The Internet has broadened many aspects of our lives in untold positive ways.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"461","weight":0.0313,"docData":{"date":"10\/02\/15","money":"728","wordCount":"64","university":"B","abstract":"This article reports on a one year, mixed methods study of 13 teacher educators at work in English and Scottish higher education institutions.

The 15 Report Cards were presented at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children in Toronto on May 20, 2014. The consolidated findings are summarized here in the form of a global matrix of grades. There is a large spread in grades across countries for most indicators. Countries that lead in certain indicators lag in others. Overall, the grades for indicators of physical activity (PA) around the world are low\/poor. Many countries have insufficient information to assign a grade, particularly for the Active Play and Family and Peers indicators. Grades for Sedentary Behaviors are, in general, better in low income countries. The Community and Built Environment indicator received high grades in high income countries and notably lower grades in low income countries.

No significant candidate was found. Upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning IMBHBs with total masses between 100 and 450 M-circle dot and mass ratios between 0.25 and 1 were placed by combining this analysis with an analogous search performed on data from the first LIGO-Virgo joint science run (November 2005-October 2007).

We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers.

When a genuine bis-amide lithium magnesiate solution is used, the deprotonation results were essentially identical to those obtained for \"LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe3)2\". By adding LiCl to \"LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe3)2\" the er at 0°C improved to 81:19. At -78°C good yields and an er of 93:7 were obtained.

Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp.

Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.","title":"Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence","authors":"E & A"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":26.0,"label":"search"},{"weight":14.0,"label":"gravitational"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"ligo"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"wave"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"run"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"virgo"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"waveform"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"dot"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"circle"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"science"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"mass"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"adv"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"angular"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"upper"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"imbhb"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"binary"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"momenta"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"aligo"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"ninja"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"sensitivity"}],"topicIndex":12,"mainTopicIds":["7","0","15"]},{"topicId":"13","topDocs":[{"docId":"147","weight":0.7059,"docData":{"date":"23\/09\/17","money":"134","wordCount":"54","university":"C","abstract":"We study here optimized Schwarz domain decomposition methods for solving the time-harmonic Maxwell equations discretized by a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.

If each wind turbine in a wind farm is forecasted individually, this considerably increases the computational cost, especially for a large wind farm. In this work, a compromise approach is developed where the turbines in the wind farm are clustered and a forecast made for each cluster. Three clustering methods are evaluated: K-means; a self-organizing map (SOM); and spectral clustering (SC). At first, wind turbines in a wind farm are clustered into several groups by identifying similar characteristics of wind speed and output power. Sihouette coefficient and Hopkins statistics indices are adopted to determine the optimal cluster number which is an important parameter in cluster analysis. Next, forecasting models of the selected representative wind turbines for each cluster based on correlation analysis are established separately. A comparative study of the forecast effect is carried to determine the most effective clustering method. Results show that the short-term wind power forecasting on the basis of SOM and SC clustering are effective to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm with better accuracy, respectively, 1.67% and 1.43% than the forecasts using a single wind speed or power to represent the wind farm. Both Hopkins statistics and Sihouette coefficient are effective in choosing the optimal number of clusters. In addition, SOM with its higher forecast accuracy and SC with more efficient calculation when applied into wind power forecasts can provide guidance for the operating and dispatching of wind power.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method.

But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method.

The method's damage assessment properties are first demonstrated on a numerical example for a two degree-of-freedom (2DOF) spring-mass and damper system with non-linear stiffness. The method is then applied to an experimental case study of a composite laminate beam. The method is based on the decomposition of the frequency domain structural variation response using new variables, the Principal Components (PCs).

The average path length appears to be more important; the range for the control strategy is wider with the length, but the optimal radius of control also extends. As the proportion of individuals in cliques and therefore the coefficient of clustering is higher, the range of the costs for which control scenario is optimal is greater.

If each wind turbine in a wind farm is forecasted individually, this considerably increases the computational cost, especially for a large wind farm. In this work, a compromise approach is developed where the turbines in the wind farm are clustered and a forecast made for each cluster. Three clustering methods are evaluated: K-means; a self-organizing map (SOM); and spectral clustering (SC). At first, wind turbines in a wind farm are clustered into several groups by identifying similar characteristics of wind speed and output power. Sihouette coefficient and Hopkins statistics indices are adopted to determine the optimal cluster number which is an important parameter in cluster analysis. Next, forecasting models of the selected representative wind turbines for each cluster based on correlation analysis are established separately. A comparative study of the forecast effect is carried to determine the most effective clustering method. Results show that the short-term wind power forecasting on the basis of SOM and SC clustering are effective to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm with better accuracy, respectively, 1.67% and 1.43% than the forecasts using a single wind speed or power to represent the wind farm. Both Hopkins statistics and Sihouette coefficient are effective in choosing the optimal number of clusters. In addition, SOM with its higher forecast accuracy and SC with more efficient calculation when applied into wind power forecasts can provide guidance for the operating and dispatching of wind power.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"22","weight":0.2787,"docData":{"date":"06\/10\/17","money":"642","wordCount":"122","university":"C","abstract":"A complex 3-stage gearbox design, in which one planetary\ngear set at first stage and two sets of parallel gears at second\nand third stage, is conventionally applied on the large wind\nturbine configuration with Doubly Fed Induction Generator.\nIn this variable-speed wind turbine, it is hard to directly apply\nconventional frequency analysis on condition monitoring of\nthe gearbox planetary stage.

This study sought to explore the relationship between the local wind and wave resources and consider how they track the islands\u2019 indigenous demand for electricity. This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand \ndata gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional \ngeneration available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from \nwind and wave sources.","title":"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"658","weight":0.09,"docData":{"date":"05\/07\/15","money":"193","wordCount":"102","university":"B","abstract":"A pulsewidth modulation (PWM) current source wind energy conversion system based on a parallel configuration for high voltage direct current application is proposed.

The analysis has been performed by integrating the Life Cycle Assessment concept into a linear programming model for the yearly decisions on which option should be used to minimize the electricity generation cost. The model has been applied for the case of Greece for the years 2012-2050 and has led to several interesting results. Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased. Summing-up, external cost has been found to be a significant percentage of the total electricity generation cost for some energy sources, therefore significantly changing the ranking order of cost-competitiveness for the energy sources examined.","title":"Incorporating life cycle external cost in optimization of the electricity generation mix","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"490","weight":0.058,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"853","wordCount":"71","university":"C","abstract":"Passive mode-locking in semiconductor lasers in a Fabry-Perot configuration with a bandgap blueshift applied to the saturable absorber (SA) section has been experimentally characterized.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"321","weight":0.1,"docData":{"date":"03\/10\/17","money":"897","wordCount":"120","university":"D","abstract":"Chemical investigation of a sample of propolis originating from North-Western Cameroon led to the isolation of thirteen alk(en)ylphenols (1-13) (inseparable mixture) along with α-amyrin (14), β-amyrin (15), lupeol (16), cycloartenol (17), mangiferonic acid (18), ambonic acid (19), mangiferolic acid (20), ambolic acid (21), isomangiferolic acid (22) and nine alk(en)ylresorcinols (23-31) (inseparable mixture).

Under pure 50 Hz conditions, four clusters of data points can be identified in the plot and the formation of the clusters is discussed. Further investigation was performed by running the samples to breakdown. The results show that even in the presence of harmonics, an increase of PD occurrence and phase distribution translates into the expected PSA pattern, where clusters of data points merge to form a 45° straight line.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.

The study provides an assessment of how well the proposed model can predict the data one hour ahead and what improvements can be accomplished by using additional data from the COSMO model.","title":"Wind prediction enhancement by supplementing measurements with numerical weather prediction now-casts","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"234","weight":0.1283,"docData":{"date":"07\/07\/15","money":"357","wordCount":"80","university":"B","abstract":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, widely present in the environment, is well known for its ability to cause infection in immune compromised individuals.

Here, we describe how Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to detect the presence of four different strains of P. aeruginosa. Using a low cost, screen printed carbon electrode significant changes can be seen in impedance data in the presence of P. aeruginosa after 24 hours. Furthermore, through the use of a normalization technique whereby the phase angle of the impedance (a commonly used parameter) is divided by a starting measurement, it is possible to identify differences between a non-mucoid and mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa. Sensors based upon the techniques described here could be used in a number of healthcare scenarios, where there is a need for low cost, real time detection of P. aeruginosa, such as CF.","title":"Development of a diagnostic device to detect different pseudomonas aeruginosa phenotypes in medically relevant contexts","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"547","weight":0.0852,"docData":{"date":"14\/04\/19","money":"575","wordCount":"97","university":"C","abstract":"Aims.

With this rapid growth in demand, data centres are under pressure to provide ever increasing data rates through their networks and at the same time improve the quality of data handling in terms of reduced latency, increased scalability and improved channel speed for users. However as data rates increase, present technology based on well-established CMOS technology is becoming increasingly difficult to scale and consequently data networks are struggling to satisfy current network demand. In this paper the interrelated issues of electronic scalability, power consumption, limited copper interconnect bandwidth and the limited speed of CMOS electronics will be explored alongside the tremendous bandwidth potential of optical fibre based photonic networks.

The LCL-filter is nowadays the preferred solution as it allows lower inductance values. In order to solve the stability concerns, active damping is preferred to passive damping since it does not use dissipative elements. However, large variations in the grid inductance and resonances arising from parallel converters may still compromise the system stability. This calls for a robust design of LCL-filters with active damping. This paper proposes a design flow with little iteration for two well-known methods, namely lead-lag network and current capacitor feedback. The proposed formulas for the resonance frequency, grid and converter inductance ratio, and capacitance of the LCL-filter allow calculating all the LCL-filter parameters. An estimation for the achieved Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the grid current is also provided. Experimental results show very robust designs to the parameter variations.","title":"Robust design of LCL-filters for active damping in grid converters","authors":"H"}},{"docId":"232","weight":0.0616,"docData":{"date":"30\/11\/19","money":"828","wordCount":"73","university":"E","abstract":"We report a fully stabilized 1030-nm Yb-fiber frequency comb operating at a pulse repetition frequency of 375 MHz.

The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage. Using sub-metered load data from various domestic wet appliances, the proposed technique is demonstrated learning the appliance operating likelihood surfaces from no prior knowledge.","title":"Self-learning load characteristic models for smart appliances","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"149","weight":0.0541,"docData":{"date":"16\/02\/18","money":"759","wordCount":"75","university":"A","abstract":"An advanced transient CFD model of a positive displacement reciprocating pump was created to study its behavior and performance in cavitating conditions throughout the inlet stroke.

However the islands\u2019 position on the UK electrical grid\u2019s periphery, with restricted local network capacity and only a limited connection to \nthe mainland, makes it more challenging to capitalise on this advantage. This study sought to explore the relationship between the local wind and wave resources and consider how they track the islands\u2019 indigenous demand for electricity. This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand \ndata gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional \ngeneration available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from \nwind and wave sources.","title":"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"583","weight":0.0463,"docData":{"date":"15\/03\/17","money":"409","wordCount":"245","university":"C","abstract":"Objective: To evaluate the impact of a diet and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) on weight change in people with a body mass index >25 weight (kg)\/height (m)2 at increased risk of colorectal cancer and other obesity related comorbidities. Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Four Scottish National Health Service health boards. Participants 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test result, as part of the national bowel screening programme, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomised to intervention and 166 to control. Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight. Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Differences between groups were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. Conclusions: Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening programme, offering considerable potential for risk reduction of disease in older adults.","title":"The impact of a bodyweight and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening programme: randomised controlled trial","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"538","weight":0.0446,"docData":{"date":"31\/08\/16","money":"681","wordCount":"157","university":"D","abstract":"Power curve measurements provide a conventional and effective means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine, both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"44","weight":0.0385,"docData":{"date":"10\/01\/19","money":"193","wordCount":"78","university":"E","abstract":"The growing impact of the \u2018\u2018analytics\u2019\u2019 perspective in recent years, which integrates advanced data-mining and learning methods, is often associated with increasing access to large databases and with decision support systems.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"750","weight":0.5158,"docData":{"date":"28\/09\/19","money":"654","wordCount":"191","university":"B","abstract":"Establishing day-case surgery as the preferred hospital admission route for all eligible patients requires adequate preoperative assessment of patients in order to quickly distinguish those who will require minimum assessment and are suitable for day-case admission from those who will require more extensive management and will need to be admitted as inpatients. As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes.

This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines. Similarly, system designers can devise interfaces that suit students' needs.","title":"Student search behaviour in an online public access catalogue: an examination of 'searching mental models' and 'searcher self-concept'","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"710","weight":0.1744,"docData":{"date":"24\/06\/17","money":"356","wordCount":"109","university":"C","abstract":"It is increasingly accepted that the change process underpinning the intended outcomes of community supervision, namely community safety, social rehabilitation and reintegration, cannot be achieved without the service user's active involvement and participation in the process. Their consent, compliance and cooperation is therefore necessary to achieving these outcomes and yet, when it comes to very high risk sexual and violent offenders, in the pursuit of community safety, control oriented, preventative practices predominate over change focused, participatory approaches. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 professionals' and 26 service users' to explore how, under the auspices of MAPPA, the supervisory process is enacted and experienced and the extent and means through which it affects people\u2019s willingness to accept or invest in not only the process but the purpose of supervision. It is argued that how the process of community supervision is experienced and what it comprises, not only shapes the outcomes of supervision, but also the nature of consent, compliance and cooperation. We conclude by advocating for more participatory processes and practices to promote service users' active engagement in, and ownership of, the process of change, and in that, the realisation of both the normative dimensions and intended outcomes of community supervision.","title":"Managing high risk offenders in the community: compliance, cooperation and consent in a climate of concern","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"536","weight":0.1704,"docData":{"date":"03\/06\/19","money":"852","wordCount":"136","university":"B","abstract":"The aim of cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is to inform the allocation of scarce resources. CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"660","weight":0.1667,"docData":{"date":"13\/05\/16","money":"383","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Research into consumer ethnicity is a vital discipline that has substantially evolved in the past three decades.

Furthermore, as the case law analysis demonstrates, the traditional hierarchy of rights by which civil and political rights were prioritised over their economic and social counterparts, has given way to an EU legal order whereby the economic imperative remains paramount with social provisions, in the context of labour rights, subjugated and subject to further divisions.","title":"The EU and the ECHR: collective and non-discrimination labour rights at a crossroad?","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"288","weight":0.1559,"docData":{"date":"08\/10\/15","money":"572","wordCount":"77","university":"E","abstract":"With the recent rise in popularity of wearable personal health monitoring devices, a number of concerns regarding user privacy are raised, specifically with regard to how the providers of these devices make use of the data obtained from these devices, and the protections that user data enjoys.

While the facts of Femarbel and Ottica do not bear much resemblance to each other, the judgments illustrate that the definition of what falls under the umbrella of healthcare services is not always obvious. Moreover, the cases provide a timely example of attempts by commercial interest groups to use EU law to open up domestic healthcare markets to private, commercial service providers. As such, the judgments have the potential to provide more clarity on the scope of the Directive 2006\/123 on services in the internal market (\"the Services Directive\") and Member States' discretion in regulating healthcare provision in their territory.

Her informal transatlantic alliance with U.S. President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989 played an important role in the promotion of an international neoliberal policy agenda that remains influential today. Her critique of UK social democracy during the 1970s and her adoption of key neoliberal strategies, such as financial deregulation, trade liberalization, and the privatization of public goods and services, were popularly labeled Thatcherism. In this article, we consider the nature of Thatcherism and its impact on health and well-being during her period as prime minister and, to a lesser extent, in the years that follow; we focus mainly on Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments.

This paper explores the safeguarding concerns and responses for children and young people who run away or go missing from home. The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.","title":"'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"499","weight":0.5417,"docData":{"date":"04\/08\/17","money":"164","wordCount":"24","university":"C","abstract":"At CELCIS, our ultimate goal is really quite simple.

Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.","title":"Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"572","weight":0.416,"docData":{"date":"11\/09\/18","money":"216","wordCount":"125","university":"D","abstract":"Graph-based signal processing (GSP) is an emerging field that is based on representing a dataset using a discrete signal indexed by a graph. Inspired by the recent success of GSP in image processing and signal filtering, in this paper, we demonstrate how GSP can be applied to non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM) due to smoothness of appliance load signatures. NALM refers to disaggregating total energy consumption in the house down to individual appliances used. At low sampling rates, in the order of minutes, NALM is a difficult problem, due to significant random noise, unknown base load, many household appliances that have similar power signatures, and the fact that most domestic appliances (for example, microwave, toaster), have usual operation of just over a minute. In this paper, we proposed a different NALM approach to more traditional approaches, by representing the dataset of active power signatures using a graph signal. We develop a regularization on graph approach where by maximizing smoothness of the underlying graph signal, we are able to perform disaggregation. Simulation results using publicly available REDD dataset demonstrate potential of the GSP for energy disaggregation and competitive performance with respect to more complex Hidden Markov Model-based approaches.","title":"A graph-based signal processing approach for low-rate energy disaggregation","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"256","weight":0.3864,"docData":{"date":"28\/12\/18","money":"708","wordCount":"44","university":"A","abstract":"An incomplete quantum measurement can induce non-trivial dynamics between degenerate subspaces, a closed sequence of such projections produces a non-abelian holonomy.

The phase of\nthe pilot signal is chosen based on the selected mapping (SLM) algorithm while the maximum likelihood criterion is used to estimate the pilot signal at the receiver. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the pilot-assisted optical OFDM system is identical to that of the basic optical OFDM (with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented) at the desired BER of less than 10−3 needed to establish a reliable communication link. The pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique results in higher reduction in PAPR for high order (M >4) constellations than the classical SLM. With respect to a basic OFDM system, with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented, a pilot-assisted M-QAM optical OFDM system is capable of reducing the electrical PAPR by over about 2.5 dB at a modest complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) point of 10−4 forM = 64. Greater reductions in PAPR are possible at lower values of CCDF with no degradation to the system\u2019s error performance. Clipping the time domain signal at both ends mildly (at 25 times the signal variance level) results in a PAPR reduction of about 6.3 dB at the same CCDF of 10−4 but with an error floor of about 3 × 10−5 .

In this study the methodology is developed for the case of a free decay response. The measured acceleration vectors are transformed into the frequency domain and then used to define a trajectory matrix. The covariance matrix of the trajectory matrix is decomposed into new variables, the Principal Components (PCs). They define a new space of linearly correlated variables onto which the dynamics\/motion of the system can be projected. This decomposition is used to uncover oscillation patterns among other purposes. The method is applied and demonstrated for the case of a simple 2-DoF system. To demonstrate its capabilities for damage diagnosis different levels of stiffness reduction are introduced. The first two PCs are used to visually demonstrate the abilities of the methodology. The Mahalanobis distance is used to develop a classification system to detect and localize delamination in the 2-DoF system.

To overcome such drawbacks, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, a severe bottleneck is how to compute the PCA covariance matrix efficiently and avoid computational difficulties, especially when the spatial dimension of the hypercube is large. In this paper, structured covariance PCA (SC-PCA) is proposed for fast computation of the covariance matrix. In line with how spectral data is acquired in either the push-broom or tunable filter way, different implementation schemes of SC-PCA are presented. As the proposed SC-PCA can determine the covariance matrix from partial covariance matrices in parallel even without deducting the mean vector in prior, it facilitates real-time data analysis whilst the hypercube is acquired. This has significantly reduced the scale of required memory and also allows efficient onsite feature extraction and data reduction to benefit subsequent tasks in coding\/compression, transmission, and analytics of hyperspectral data.","title":"Structured covariance principal component analysis for real-time onsite feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"307","weight":0.1755,"docData":{"date":"16\/10\/18","money":"883","wordCount":"57","university":"A","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the stability analysis of continuous-time switched systems with a random switching signal.

The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.","title":"An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"543","weight":0.153,"docData":{"date":"14\/01\/18","money":"105","wordCount":"85","university":"C","abstract":"This paper presents a new electromyography activity detection technique in which 1-D local binary pattern histograms are used to distinguish between periods of activity and inactivity in myoelectric signals.

The algorithm is compared to other offline single- and double-threshold activity detection methods and, for the data sets tested, it is shown to have a better overall performance with greater tolerance to the noise in the real data set used.","title":"Lower arm electromyography (EMG) activity detection using local binary patterns","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"8","weight":0.1429,"docData":{"date":"11\/01\/17","money":"194","wordCount":"168","university":"E","abstract":"Many mission scenarios for nanosatellites and CubeSat hardware have already been created that will require autonomous target tracking and rendezvous maneuvers in close proximity to other orbiting objects. While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"186","weight":0.1411,"docData":{"date":"18\/05\/17","money":"574","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"In The Changing Body (Cambridge University Press and NBER, 2011), the authors presented a series of estimates showing the number of calories available for human consumption in England and Wales at various points in time between 1700 and 1909\/13.

Consequently, coding and compression is needed for effective data reduction whilst maintaining the image integrity. In this paper, a multivariate vector quantization (MVQ) approach is proposed for the compression of HSI, where the pixel spectra is considered as a linear combination of two codewords from the codebook, and the indexed maps and their corresponding coefficients are separately coded and compressed. A strategy is proposed for effective codebook design, using the fuzzy C-mean (FCM) to determine the optimal number of clusters of data and selected codewords for the codebook. Comprehensive experiments on several real datasets are used for performance assessment, including quantitative evaluations to measure the degree of data reduction and the distortion of reconstructed images. Our results have indicated that the proposed MVQ approach outperforms conventional VQ and several typical algorithms for effective compression of HSI, where the image quality measured using mean squared error (MSE) has been significantly improved even under the same level of compressed bitrate.","title":"Novel multivariate vector quantization for effective compression of hyperspectral imagery","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"88","weight":0.1334,"docData":{"date":"17\/09\/17","money":"894","wordCount":"46","university":"E","abstract":"We report an integrated all-optical radio frequency spectrum analyzer based on a ∼4cm long doped silica glass waveguide, with a bandwidth greater than 2.5 THz.

Preservation of inner retinal circuitry is critical to the fidelity of this transmitted signal to ganglion cells and beyond to higher visual targets. Post-implantation loss of retinal interneurons or excessive glial scarring could diminish and\/or eliminate PVA-evoked signal transmission. As such, assessing the morphology of the inner retina in RP animal models with subretinal PVAs is an important step in defining biocompatibility and predicting success of signal transmission. In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively compare inner retinal morphology after the implantation of a PVA in two RP models: the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) or transgenic S334ter-line 3 (S334ter-3) rhodopsin mutant rat. Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices. In the S334ter-3 rat, we implanted devices at 6-12 weeks of age and again, inner retinal morphology was generally preserved with either PVA design 16-26 weeks post-implantation. Specifically, the length of rod bipolar cells and numbers of cholinergic amacrine cells were maintained along with their characteristic inner plexiform lamination patterns. Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site. Our results indicate that subretinally implanted PVAs are well-tolerated in rodent RP models and that the inner retinal circuitry is preserved, consistent with our published results showing implant-evoked signal transmission.","title":"Inner retinal preservation in rat models of retinal degeneration implanted with subretinal photovoltaic arrays","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"605","weight":0.091,"docData":{"date":"19\/02\/18","money":"406","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"The MaidSafe network is an open-source, decentralised, autonomous network for data storage and retrieval by end user applications.

The protocol is orders of magnitude faster than previous protocols because it employs mostly cheap cryptographic operations, e.g. hashing and modular multiplication. The performance has been further improved by parallelization. We implemented the protocol and tested the performance. The test result shows that on moderate commodity hardware, the dot product of two vectors of size 1 million can be computed within 1 minute.

The variation in signal with depth is consistent with that observed previously for transmission Raman spectrometry. In both cases, the trend observed can be attributed to lower photon density at the air-sample interface, relative to the center of the sample, owing to loss of photons to the air. This results in a reduction in the number of photons absorbed or Raman photons generated and subsequently detected when the interlayer occupies a near-surface position.","title":"Variation in the transmission near-infrared signal with depth in turbid media","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"510","weight":0.0824,"docData":{"date":"25\/08\/19","money":"388","wordCount":"85","university":"C","abstract":"In this article, Meer tentatively delineates three ways in which he understands that the concept of Islamophobia is being informed by postcolonial scholarship.

We prove that strictly classical bipartite correlations may still require global entanglement and that unentangled---albeit not strictly classical---reductions may require global genuine multipartite entanglement, rather than simple entanglement. On the other hand, for three qubits, the strict classicality of the bipartite reductions rules out the need for genuine multipartite entanglement.

Participants 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test result, as part of the national bowel screening programme, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomised to intervention and 166 to control. Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight. Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group.

Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition.

Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"791","weight":0.2254,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/15","money":"772","wordCount":"144","university":"C","abstract":"In 2008, a national human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation programme began in Scotland for 12\u201313 year old females with a three-year catch-up campaign for those under the age of 18. Since 2008, three-dose uptake of bivalent vaccine in the routine cohort aged 12\u201313 has exceeded 90% annually, while in the catch-up cohort overall uptake is 66%.  To monitor the impact of HPV immunisation, a programme of national surveillance was established (pre and post introduction) which included yearly sampling and HPV genotyping of women attending for cervical screening at age 20. By linking individual vaccination, screening and HPV testing records, we aim to determine the impact of the immunisation programme on circulating type-specific HPV infection particularly for four outcomes: (i) the vaccine types HPV 16 or 18 (ii) types considered to be associated with cross-protection: HPV 31, 33 or 45; (iii) all other high-risk types and (iv) any HPV.  From a total of 4679 samples tested, we demonstrate that three doses (n=1100) of bivalent vaccine are associated with a significant reduction in prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 from 29.8% (95% confidence interval 28.3, 31.3%) to 13.6% (95% confidence interval 11.7, 15.8%). The data also suggest cross-protection against HPV 31, 33 and 45. HPV 51 and 56 emerged as the most prevalent (10.5% and 9.6%, respectively) non-vaccine high-risk types in those vaccinated, but at lower rates than HPV 16 (25.9%) in those unvaccinated.

Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives. The decrease in acquisition risk post-SOX cannot be solely attributed to changes in the structure of executive compensation but it additionally stems from the way managers perceive compensation-based incentives in the new regulatory environment.

We report the associations of lifetime exposure to ambient UVR with cataract extraction and AMD. The Alienor Study is a population-based study of 963 residents of Bordeaux (France), aged 73 years or more. Lifetime exposure to ambient UVR was estimated from residential history and Eurosun satellite-based estimations of ground UVR. It was divided in three groups (lower quartile, intermediate quartiles, upper quartile), using the intermediate quartiles as the reference. Early and late AMD was classified from retinal color photographs. Cataract extraction was defined as absence of the natural lens at slit-lamp. After multivariate adjustment, subjects in the upper quartile of lifetime ambient UVR exposure were at increased risk for cataract extraction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.26; P = 0.03) and for early AMD (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.44; P = 0.03), by comparison with subjects in the intermediate quartiles.

Associations of late AMD with UVR exposure was not statistically significant. This study further confirms the increased risk for cataract extraction in subjects exposed to high ambient UVR. Moreover, it suggests that risk for early AMD is increased in subjects exposed to high UVR, but also to low UVR, by comparison with medium exposures.","title":"Lifetime exposure to ambient ultraviolet radiation and the risk for cataract extraction and age-related macular degeneration: the Alienor Study","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"522","weight":0.1323,"docData":{"date":"08\/09\/15","money":"696","wordCount":"124","university":"B","abstract":"Following recent attempts to quantify articulatory impairment in speech, we evaluate the usefulness of a novel measure of motor stability to characterise dysarthria.

Each participant performed a series of sentence repetitions under habitual, fast and slow speaking rate conditions. We used an algorithm to measure utterance-to-utterance spectro-temporal variation (UUV; Cummins, 2009). Speech rate and intelligibility were also measured.  UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the ataxic, but not the HD groups, presumably due to differences in intelligibility in the samples employed, and not to differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared to habitual and fast speaking rates.  UUV results are consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way. The results suggest that the UUV could be developed into an easy to use clinical tool that could function as a valid and reliable assessment and outcome measure.","title":"The quantitative assessment of interutterance stability: application to dysarthric speech","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"562","weight":0.126,"docData":{"date":"22\/10\/17","money":"203","wordCount":"127","university":"B","abstract":"Outcome measures of breast reconstruction have used panel assessment of photographs.

In this review, we summarise this information, focussing on the accumulating evidence that genetic dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses and post-synaptic signalling complexes contributes to the aetiology of the disease. In particular, there is converging support for involvement of post-synaptic JNK pathways in disease aetiology.

These applications, and many others, are all defined in the Sun-Earth three-body problem, while little research has been conducted to investigate the potential of solar sailing in the Earth-Moon three-body problem. This paper therefore aims to find solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem, in particular Lagrange-point orbits. By introducing a solar sail acceleration to the Earth-Moon three-body problem, the system becomes non-autonomous and constraints on the orbital period need to be imposed. In this paper, the problem is solved as a two-point boundary value problem together with a continuation approach: starting from a natural Lagrange-point orbit, the solar sail acceleration is gradually increased and the result for the previous sail performance is used as an initial guess for a slightly better sail performance. Three in-plane steering laws are considered for the sail, two where the attitude of the sail is fixed in the synodic reference frame (perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line) and one where the sail always faces the Sun. The results of the paper include novel families of solar sail Lyapunov and Halo orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lagrange points, respectively. These orbits are double-revolution orbits that wind around or are off-set with respect to the natural Lagrange-point orbit. Finally, the effect of an out-of-plane solar sail acceleration component and that of the Sun-sail configuration is investigated, giving rise to additional families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem.","title":"Solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"573","weight":0.5764,"docData":{"date":"16\/12\/17","money":"673","wordCount":"288","university":"A","abstract":"Solar sails have long been considered as a means of enabling new high-energy missions, such as solar polar orbiter, planetary sample return and heliopause probes, along with families of highly non-Keplerian orbits for space weather and Earth observation missions, as reviewed in Refs 1 and 2.  While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"784","weight":0.5698,"docData":{"date":"10\/01\/19","money":"890","wordCount":"86","university":"E","abstract":"This work deals with the generation of first-guess interplanetary trajectories\nconnecting Libration Point Orbits (LPOs) belonging to different restricted three body problems.

Previous proposals have recommended the use of a 2-phase transfer to reach a solar polar orbit, however a 3-phase transfer has since been shown to offer a significant reduction in the transfer time at the expense of higher thermal stresses. The 3-phase transfer involves spiralling in close to the Sun, performing a rapid inclination increase, and spiralling back out to the final target orbit. A general perturbation solution for such a transfer has been defined which offers significant advantages over the numerically optimised solutions currently available. The insights provided by this analytical solution are used here to rapidly generate a holistic understanding of the mission architecture options available and hence how the mission and system design could be traded. A number of potential science missions are identified which could benefit uniquely from the use of such an orbit. These require that a solar latitude of 60° be achieved within 5 years before proceeding to a true polar orbit. A comparison between the use of the 2- and 3-phase transfer options identify that in real terms, the 3-phase transfer will reach a polar orbit approximately 1 year ahead of the 2-phase transfer. In addition, the increased efficiency of the transfer would allow for an increase in the allowable\npayload mass; with up to an extra 33kg payload potential predicted. Further work should allow for the mission and system design to be traded; for example to investigate the implications of increased thermal system mass (due to a reduction in the minimum solar approach distance) against reduced transfer time or sail size.","title":"Scientific mission to a solar polar orbit using solar sail propulsion","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"222","weight":0.4688,"docData":{"date":"02\/03\/16","money":"200","wordCount":"162","university":"C","abstract":"The orbital dynamics around the Libration points of the classical circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) have been investigated in detail: in the last few decades, dynamical systems theory has provided invaluable analytical and numerical tools for understanding the dynamics of Libration Point Orbits (LPOs). The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon\u2019s surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system. Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics.

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites.

Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous. Users also find the placement of apogee over the pole to be preferable to the alternative scenarios.

Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods.

To estimate the protection system weight and losses, scalable models of cryogenic bidirectional current-source converters, cryogenic bidirectional IGBT solid-state circuit breakers, and resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters are developed to assess how the weight and losses of these components vary as a function of nominal voltage and current and fault current ratings. The scalable models are used to assess the protection system weight for several trade-offs.  System studies include the trade-off in fault-current limiting capability of SFCL on CB mass, alongside the fault-current limiting capability of the converter and its impact on CB fault-current interruption ratings and weight.","title":"Turboelectric distributed propulsion protection system design trades","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"793","weight":0.0667,"docData":{"date":"17\/08\/19","money":"177","wordCount":"15","university":"A","abstract":"One man is on a mission to bring peace to Uganda\u2019s living and its dead by recording the unreported atrocities of its 20-year war.","title":"Mapping mass atrocities","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"169","weight":0.0662,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/17","money":"377","wordCount":"137","university":"A","abstract":"The thermal protection system is a key element in atmospheric re-entry missions of aerospace vehicles. Usually, in the thermal load calculations, the analysis assumes that the vehicle has a smooth surface. However, discontinuities or imperfections are often present on the aerospace vehicle surfaces due to fabrication tolerances, sensor installations, spaces between the thermal protection plates, and differential expansion or ablation rates between non-similar materials. In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80km in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used. The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality plays a key role in the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4.  A study of the influence of the cavity width has also been conducted.

This paper researches the scheduling problem for dynamic tasks oriented to some emergency cases. After the dynamic properties of satellite scheduling were analyzed, the optimization model is proposed in this paper. Based on the model, two heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. The first heuristic algorithm arranges new tasks by inserting or deleting them, then inserting them repeatedly according to the priority from low to high, which is named IDI algorithm. The second one called ISDR adopts four steps: insert directly, insert by shifting, insert by deleting, and reinsert the tasks deleted. Moreover, two heuristic factors, congestion degree of a time window and the overlapping degree of a task, are employed to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance. Finally, a case is given to test the algorithms. The results show that the IDI algorithm is better than ISDR from the running time point of view while ISDR algorithm with heuristic factors is more effective with regard to algorithm performance. Moreover, the results also show that our method has good performance for the larger size of the dynamic tasks in comparison with the other two methods.","title":"Heuristic scheduling algorithm oriented dynamic tasks for imaging satellites","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"263","weight":0.061,"docData":{"date":"12\/03\/18","money":"628","wordCount":"164","university":"D","abstract":"Various plants have the ability to follow the sun with their flowers or leaves during the course of a day via a mechanism known as heliotropism. This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations. Example applications of this lightweight shape changing structure include concentrators, mirrors, and communications antennas that are able to dynamically change their focal point, as well as substructures for solar sails that are capable of steering through solar winds by altering the sails׳ subjected area.","title":"Inflatable shape changing colonies assembling versatile smart space structures","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"110","weight":0.0417,"docData":{"date":"25\/05\/17","money":"311","wordCount":"121","university":"C","abstract":"One of the challenges of Active Debris Removal is related to the tumbling of the target satellite, when the chaser spacecraft has to approach and capture it. This paper presents the ASEM (Attitude Stabilization Electromagnetic Module) concept for detumbling debris in a low Earth orbit with the intention of mitigating risk during capture operations. This paper presents a preliminary design of a system whose purpose is to stabilize a target\u2019s attitude, using an external module equipped with magnetorquers. The device, initially carried by the chaser spacecraft, is attached to the body of the target satellite. The magnetorquers are then used to detumble the target so that the chaser spacecraft can perform a safe approach prior to capture. A simplified model is used in the initial design phase to optimize the mass of the system and to size the torque rods and power source. Alternative methods for attaching the ASEM to the target from the chaser spacecraft are discussed. In addition a novel magnetic control law suitable for this application is presented. The feasibility of the concept is tested in simulations using a model based on Envisat (assuming that the ASEM is already attached to the target). Results show that a module weighing less than 20 kg can stabilize an 8-ton satellite initially rotating at 1 rpm in 21 days.","title":"Design of an attitude stabilization electromagnetic module for detumbling uncooperative targets","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"2","weight":0.0368,"docData":{"date":"15\/09\/19","money":"431","wordCount":"136","university":"C","abstract":"This paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational waves from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB).

On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments.

PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.

To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed. The results of a simulation made in QForm are analyzed and compared with some initial experimental data.","title":"FEM Simulation of microstructure refinement during severe deformation","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"717","weight":0.0068,"docData":{"date":"19\/08\/19","money":"351","wordCount":"150","university":"B","abstract":"Production of soluble (instant) coffee powders typically involves extraction of roasted coffee by water followed by evaporation in order to concentrate extracts before spray or freeze drying to produce dry coffee powder. In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"641","weight":0.0063,"docData":{"date":"22\/08\/18","money":"681","wordCount":"163","university":"B","abstract":"Much is made of the concept best practice. It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned.

As scale increased, remediation efficiency of 97\u201399.95% was maintained.

The pilot field-scale experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000mg\/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with increasing scale.

We report association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and HLA types in a cohort of individuals affected by language impairment.  We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed HLA types.  Quantitative association analyses of imputed HLA types suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A1 was associated with a measure of short-term memory (P = 0.004) and A3 with expressive language ability (P = 0.006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B8 and HLA-DQA1*0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0.021, P = 0.034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0.013, P = 0.029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed HLA types indicated that the DR10 allele of HLA-DRB1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0.004, relative risk = 2.575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

One significant area where there is a need for better understanding is in improving the efficiency of oligonucleotide delivery to the cell and indeed, following delivery, the characterization of the effects on the cell. Methods: In this report, we compare different transfection reagents as delivery vehicles for gold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides, and quantify their relative transfection efficiencies.

Findings: We show that the use of transfection reagents does significantly increase nanoparticle transfection efficiencies. Furthermore, siRNA, ssRNA and ssDNA sequences all have comparable inhibitory properties to ssDNA sequences immobilized onto gold nanoparticles. We also show that functionalized gold nanoparticles can co-localize with autophagosomes and illustrate other factors that can affect data collection and interpretation when performing studies with functionalized nanoparticles. Conclusions: The desired outcome for biological knockdown studies is the efficient reduction of a specific target; which we demonstrate by using ssDNA inhibitory sequences targeted to human metallothionein IIa gene transcripts that result in the knockdown of both the mRNA transcript and the target protein.","title":"Quantification of functionalised gold nanoparticle-targeted knockdown of gene expression in HeLa cells","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"621","weight":0.2118,"docData":{"date":"28\/05\/18","money":"401","wordCount":"85","university":"B","abstract":"The behaviour of complex molecules, such as nanoparticles, polymers, and proteins, at liquid interfaces is of increasing importance in a number of areas of science and technology.

GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD).

The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards.

Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness.

Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1.5-1.8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20-60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate)-type crystallographic structure.

However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.","title":"Highly anisotropic metasurface: a polarized beam splitter and hologram","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"466","weight":0.275,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/16","money":"441","wordCount":"40","university":"D","abstract":"Sonic properties of spider silks are measured independent of the web using laser vibrometry and ballistic impact providing insights into Nature's design of functionalized high-performance materials.

It can be assumed that the stress distribution inside the muscles is the superposition of stresses along the fibres and the connective tissues. The mechanical behaviour of the surrounding tissues is determined by adopting a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model, while the mechanical description of fibres is considered to be the sum of active and passive stresses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, evaluation of the Jacobian matrix is carried out in order to subsequently utilise the standard Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and to carry out time integration with an implicit scheme. The proposed methodology is implemented into our in-house, open source, finite element software, which is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental measurements and other numerical results.

In the present work, the solver dsmcFoam has been benchmarked against experimental, numerical, and theoretical data found in the open literature for inert and chemically reactive flows.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":17.0,"label":"structure"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"beam"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"oam"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"variation"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"shear"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"panel"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"fibre"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"metasurface"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"disk"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"intermolecular"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"stack"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"directional"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"photon"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"diffraction"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"previously"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"systematic"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"spectrum"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"position"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"efficient"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"silk"}],"topicIndex":5,"mainTopicIds":["15","6","0"]},{"topicId":"6","topDocs":[{"docId":"462","weight":0.7481,"docData":{"date":"25\/05\/15","money":"487","wordCount":"133","university":"C","abstract":"The present study aimed to determine the validity of simple epidemiological and clinical methods for the assessment of body fatness in preschool children.

In view of the decreasing levels of physical activity and motor skills in children over the past decades, an appropriate assessment and monitoring of motor competence in early childhood is invaluable, for both research and practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the convergent validity between two motor competence assessment tools: the Körperkoordinations Test für Kinder (KTK) and the Motoriktest für Vier- bis Sechsjährige Kinder (MOT 4-6). \nMethods and results: Five hundred and thirty 5- and 6- year-old children (277 ♂ and 253 ♀; mean age = 5.95; SD = 0.57) were tested by practiced assessors on the KTK and MOT 4-6 during the same day. From the raw scores, a Motor Quotient was calculated based on normative data of the KTK and MOT 4-6. A Pearson correlation demonstrated a moderately strong positive association between KTK Motor Quotient and MOT 4-6 Motor Quotient (r = 0.605). Crosstabs showed a fair level of agreement between the two tests (K = 0.313; p < 0.001). \nConclusion: These findings show that some evidence of convergent validity between KTK and MOT 4-6 is provided in present study. However, because of the low level of agreement between KTK and MOT 4-6, practitioners and\/or clinicians need to be aware of possible categorisation errors when using the KTK or MOT 4-6 test to detect motor impairments.","title":"Motor competence assessment in young children: convergent validity between the KTK and MOT 4-6 test batteries","authors":"H"}},{"docId":"15","weight":0.4375,"docData":{"date":"12\/06\/17","money":"709","wordCount":"106","university":"A","abstract":"In a laboratory setting where both a mechanically-braked cycling ergometer and a motion analysis (MA) system are available, flywheel angular displacement can be estimated by using MA. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the validity and reliability of a MA method for measuring maximal power output (Pmax) in comparison with a force transducer (FT) method. Eight males and eight females undertook three identical sessions, separated by 4 to 6 days; the first being a familiarization session. Individuals performed three 6-second sprints against 50% of the maximal resistance to complete two pedal revolutions with a 3-minute rest between trials. Power was determined independently using both MA and FT analyses. Validity: MA recorded significantly higher Pmax than FT (P < .05). Bland-Altman plots showed that there was a systematic bias in the difference between the measures of the two systems. This difference increased as power increased. Repeatability: Intraclass correlation coefficients were on average 0.90 ± 0.05 in males and 0.85 ± 0.08 in females. Measuring Pmax by MA, therefore, is as appropriate for use in exercise physiology research as Pmax measured by FT, provided that a bias between these measurements methods is allowed for.","title":"Validity and reliability of an alternative method for measuring power output during six second all out cycling","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"389","weight":0.2392,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/18","money":"432","wordCount":"47","university":"A","abstract":"Offences which are required to be jointly reported to the Procurator Fiscal (PF) and the Children\u2019s Reporter can be found here.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically. We controversially suggest that, in order to engage girls in physical education, we may have to temporarily remove the physical domain of learning (at least for some girls) in order to positively affect their longer term engagement in the subject.","title":"Hiding behind the camera: social learning within the cooperative learning model to engage girls in physical education","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"669","weight":0.0491,"docData":{"date":"20\/09\/15","money":"791","wordCount":"104","university":"C","abstract":"An estimated one in nine children will run away from home or substitute care before their 16th birthday in the UK. This paper explores the safeguarding concerns and responses for children and young people who run away or go missing from home. The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.","title":"'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"652","weight":0.0152,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/18","money":"369","wordCount":"132","university":"E","abstract":"The significance continues to grow of scholarship that embraces critical and contextualized entrepreneurship, seeking rich explorations of diverse entrepreneurship contexts.

Whilst well implanted in the machining and cutting industry, vacuum coatings face important challenges for the fabrication of forming tools, and more specifically in hot forming, due to the extreme operation conditions to be met, such as high loading forces, impact\/thermal cycling, working material adhesion, etc. Present and future coatings adapted to hot work tooling are discussed in this paper: transition metal nitrides, carbon nitrides, borides and mixed oxides are among the currently postulated coating formulations for high temperature forming. The study is complemented with current strategies of characterizing the properties of the coatings in the adequate environment of high temperatures and contact loadings. To this aspect, a number of examples, from using standard laboratory equipment to the use of in-house developed tribological set-ups, are given, together with recent findings obtained from the authors\u2019 research groups. The data available is, however, quite limited from the scientific literatures on the field trials with reliable, statistical relevance, which is, probably, attributed to the high costs normally incurred for carrying out experiments in real industrial environment. Nevertheless, we could still draw a conclusion of that vacuum coating for tooling applications is at a front edge of knowledge generation and technology transfer to industry, and while being already mature, there is still a needed effort for significant industrial up-take from the novel coatings developed or being under the development.","title":"Vapour deposition technologies for the fabrication of hot-forming tools: a review","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"607","weight":0.0137,"docData":{"date":"01\/11\/18","money":"710","wordCount":"73","university":"A","abstract":"On touchscreen devices such as smartphones and tablets, text entry remains key to many tasks and is an important factor in the usability of such devices.

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the motor points of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.  Low frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. The electrode positions which achieved the strongest muscle contractions were recorded as the motor point positions, with measurements repeated once. For five able bodied participants, assessments were repeated after 18 months, in seated and supine positions.  Intersubject uniformity ranged from 2.8 to 8.8 %. Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of <1.7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (<1.7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3.1 cm.

Thus, it is imperative to establish the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization dynamics in the HTHAZ. This paper discusses the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization in an AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel weld. It is established that cryogenic cooling increases the cooling rate in the HTHAZ and reduces the martensite volume percent by an average of 20%. This reduction in martensite content in the HTHAZ increases the level of ditched structure in cryogenically cooled welds and yields more ferrite-martensite ditched grain boundaries than in conventional welds. Although the cryotreated welds exhibit greater ditched boundary, the structure is still classified as nonsensitized, since no single grain boundary is completely surrounded by ditches.","title":"Exploratory study of sensitization in cryogenically cooled ferritic stainless steel welds","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"697","weight":0.1915,"docData":{"date":"22\/08\/15","money":"832","wordCount":"95","university":"B","abstract":"Ocean acidification is altering the oceanic carbonate saturation state and threatening the survival of marine calcifying organisms.

Increased hull roughness leads to increased frictional resistance, causing higher fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

This paper proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model which enables the prediction of the effect of antifouling coatings on frictional resistance. It also outlines details of CFD simulations of resistance tests on coated plates in a towing tank. Initially, roughness functions and roughness Reynolds numbers for several antifouling coatings were evaluated using an indirect method.

The microstructural changes were explained simply in terms of Joule heating. A significant portion of the recrystallization process was concluded to have occurred after pulsing; i.e., during cooling to ambient temperature. The grain structure and microhardness were shown to vary noticeably in the heat-affected zone (HAZ); these observations mirrored variations of temper colors. Accordingly, the revealed microstructure heterogeneity was attributed to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution developed during pulsing. In the central part of the HAZ, the mean grain size increased with current density and this effect was associated with the temperature rise per se. This grain size was slightly smaller than that in statically recrystallized specimens.","title":"Effect of electric-current pulses on grain-structure evolution in cryogenically rolled copper","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"480","weight":0.0266,"docData":{"date":"06\/05\/19","money":"649","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete can alter the interface between the steel and concrete and thus affects the bond mechanism. This subsequently influences the behavior of reinforced concrete structures in terms of their safety and serviceability. The present paper attempts to develop a numerical method that can simulate the behavior of reinforced concrete walls subjected to steel corrosion in concrete as measured by their load-deflection relationship. The method accounts for the effects of corrosion on the stiffness, maximum strength, residual strength, and failure mode of the bond between the steel and concrete. In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate. It is found in this paper that the increase in the bond strength due to minor corrosion can increase the load-bearing capacity of the wall and the corrosion-affected reinforced concrete walls exhibit less ductile behavior compared with the uncorroded walls. The paper concludes that the developed numerical method can predict the behavior of corrosion-affected reinforced concrete seawalls with reasonable accuracy.","title":"Numerical simulation of behavior of reinforced concrete structures considering corrosion effects on bonding","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"190","weight":0.0259,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/19","money":"820","wordCount":"116","university":"B","abstract":"Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are expected to play a critical role in future energy grids. ESS technologies are primarily employed for reducing the stress on grid and the use of hydrocarbons for electricity generation. However, in order for ESS option to become economically viable, proper sizing is highly desired to recover the high capital cost. In this paper we propose a system architecture that enables us to optimally size the ESS system according to the number of users. We model the demand of each customer by a two-state Markovian fluid and the aggregate demand of all users are multiplexed at the ESS. The proposed model also draws a constant power from the grid and it is used to accommodate the customer demand and charge the storage unit, if required. Then, given the population of customers and their stochastic demands, and the power drawn from the grid we provide an analytical solution for ESS sizing using the underflow probability as the main performance metric, which is defined as the percentage of time that the system resources fall short of demand.

The two-step processed CIGS films were mechanically compressed at 25 MPa to improve their optoelectronic properties, which were verified by photoluminescence (PL). The surface and structural properties were compared before and after compression. The mechanical compression has brought changes in the surface morphology and porosity without changing the structural properties of the material. The PL technique has been used to reveal changes in the electronic properties of the films. PL spectra at different excitation laser powers and temperatures were measured for as-grown as well as compressed samples. The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation. The compression increases the intensity of energy bands by an order of magnitude and reduces the j-shift, demonstrating an improvement of the electronic properties.","title":"Effect of mechanical compression on Cu(In,Ga)Se films: micro-structural and photoluminescence analysis","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"605","weight":0.0228,"docData":{"date":"19\/02\/18","money":"406","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"The MaidSafe network is an open-source, decentralised, autonomous network for data storage and retrieval by end user applications.

In most of the cases, however, the evaluation of the genetic modification was performed only in laboratory strains, that is, in strains that are known to be quite sensitive to various types of stresses. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing genes encoding the transcription factor (YAP1) and the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (MCR1), either alone or in combination, in an already robust and xylose-consuming industrial strain of S. cerevisiae and evaluated the effect during the fermentation of undiluted and undetoxified spruce hydrolysate. Overexpression of either gene resulted in faster hexose catabolism, but no cumulative effect was observed with the simultaneous overexpression. The improved phenotype of MCR1 overexpression appeared to be related, at least in part, to a faster furaldehyde reduction capacity, indicating that this reductase may have a wider substrate range than previously reported. Unexpectedly a decreased xylose fermentation rate was also observed in YAP1 overexpressing strains and possible reasons behind this phenotype are discussed.","title":"Re-assessment of YAP1 and MCR1 contributions to inhibitor tolerance in robust engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermenting undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysate","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"533","weight":0.0122,"docData":{"date":"07\/07\/18","money":"554","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"The ion-channel laser (ICL) is an ultra-compact version of the free-electron laser (FEL), with the undulator replaced by an ion channel.

Thus, it is imperative to establish the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization dynamics in the HTHAZ. This paper discusses the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization in an AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel weld. It is established that cryogenic cooling increases the cooling rate in the HTHAZ and reduces the martensite volume percent by an average of 20%. This reduction in martensite content in the HTHAZ increases the level of ditched structure in cryogenically cooled welds and yields more ferrite-martensite ditched grain boundaries than in conventional welds. Although the cryotreated welds exhibit greater ditched boundary, the structure is still classified as nonsensitized, since no single grain boundary is completely surrounded by ditches.","title":"Exploratory study of sensitization in cryogenically cooled ferritic stainless steel welds","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"742","weight":0.0745,"docData":{"date":"07\/02\/16","money":"172","wordCount":"95","university":"B","abstract":"The effect of electric-current pulses on the evolution of microstructure and texture in cryogenically rolled copper was determined.

Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"644","weight":0.0046,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/16","money":"859","wordCount":"226","university":"E","abstract":"The successful miniaturization of spacecraft subsystems makes nanosatellites suitable candidates for many scientific missions, and several miniaturized electric propulsion systems on CubeSats have been studied. A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":10.0,"label":"uvr"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"exposure"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"aee"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"quartile"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"amd"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"increase"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"test"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"equation"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"cataract"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"pregnancy"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"extraction"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"ambient"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"cut"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"early"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"subject"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"mvpa"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"lpa"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"actical"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"cooling"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"hthaz"}],"topicIndex":8,"mainTopicIds":["16","19","6"]},{"topicId":"9","topDocs":[{"docId":"324","weight":0.5944,"docData":{"date":"25\/01\/16","money":"199","wordCount":"106","university":"E","abstract":"We report terahertz surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing based on prism-coupling to the spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) mode existing on periodically grooved metal films.

Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing \u2018jitter\u2019 at such low translation rates from a linear magnetic encoder, and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre\u2019s travel. Calibration, across the four detectors of this work, gave a vibrational responsivity in voltage terms of (9.45 ± 1.20) MV (rms) \/ metre (rms), yielding a VM displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) \/ √Hz, at 500 Hz, over the required measuring span of ±0.1 mm.","title":"Quasi-static displacement calibration system for a \"Violin-Mode\" shadow-sensor intended for gravitational wave detector suspensions","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"182","weight":0.5334,"docData":{"date":"13\/12\/15","money":"272","wordCount":"45","university":"B","abstract":"The complete description of the lifetime of a droplet on a solid substrate evaporating in a 'stick\u2013slide' mode is obtained.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"620","weight":0.3282,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/16","money":"596","wordCount":"128","university":"A","abstract":"Anybody familiar with Paul Temporal\u2019s other works would also find his latest book Islamic Branding and Marketing: Creating a Global Islamic Business informative.

The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply\u2013demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe.

The results of this study are presented in a simple \u2018decision tree\u2019 diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, chloronaphthalene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4,4\u2032-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol. Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4,4\u2032-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, chloronaphthalene and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS.

As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column.

Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems.

Here we investigate the sensitivity of ecological effects to discarding policies using an ecosystem model of the North Sea - a region where 30-40% of trawled fish catch is currently discarded. We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks. Our results highlight the importance of considering the broader ecosystem consequences of fishery management policy, since species interactions may dissipate or negate intended benefits.","title":"Cascading ecological effects of eliminating fishery discards","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"354","weight":0.0182,"docData":{"date":"19\/12\/16","money":"617","wordCount":"110","university":"E","abstract":"In this paper, large scale molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the thermal effect on nanometric cutting of copper while using a single tip and a multi-tip nanoscale diamond tool.

The results show that the cutting heat generated while using a multi-tip tool is larger than that of using a single tip tool. The local temperature is found to be higher at the inner sides of the multi-tip tool cutting edges than the outer sides. Applying centro-symmetry parameters and radius distribution function, the local annealing process and its effect on the integrity of the machined nanostructures are analyzed. It is observed that the local annealing at the machined surface can improve the surface integrity of the machined nanostructures, especially in the multi-tip diamond tool cutting process.

An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership.

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes.

The model is based on Kynch theory (Kynch, 1952), i.e. it describes systems with solids fractions sufficiently low that the solids have not gelled into a weight-bearing network. However the model incorporates a modification to describe how raking the suspension causes flocs or aggregates within it to densify. This floc densification opens up channels between the flocs through which liquid escapes, making the suspension easier to dewater. The densification theory presented here predicts profiles of varying solids fraction vs height in the settling zone in a thickener, information which is not normally available when designing thickeners via the conventional Kynch theory. Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux. As underflow solids fraction is increased, thickeners operated at a specified aggregate densification rate (or equivalently at a fixed settling zone height) tend to approach a 'fully densified' suspension state (defined as a point at which the extent of aggregate densification ceases to change with time), with improved thickening performance.","title":"Effects of aggregate densification upon thickening of Kynchian suspensions","authors":"E & A"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":9.0,"label":"pyrimidin"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"knee"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"monohydrate"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"rwandan"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"rwanda"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"valve"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"aortic"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"surgeon"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"ium"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"azanidyl"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"sulfonyl"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"azaniumylphenyl"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"tka"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"replacement"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"computer"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"history"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"assist"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"form"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"current"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"factor"}],"topicIndex":22,"mainTopicIds":["8","17","1"]},{"topicId":"23","topDocs":[{"docId":"118","weight":0.8475,"docData":{"date":"07\/05\/16","money":"503","wordCount":"64","university":"B","abstract":"In this issue of Oncogene, Albinet et al. have demonstrated a critical role of melanoma sphingosine kinase 1, which catalyses formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.

Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.6743,"docData":{"date":"23\/02\/15","money":"285","wordCount":"147","university":"C","abstract":"Biased agonism describes a multi-state model of G protein-coupled receptor activation in which each ligand induces a unique structural conformation of the receptor, such that the receptor couples differentially to G proteins and other intracellular proteins.

A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"366","weight":0.6398,"docData":{"date":"26\/12\/18","money":"482","wordCount":"183","university":"B","abstract":"ES-62 is a phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing glycoprotein secreted by the filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae that acts to modulate the host immune response to promote the establishment of chronic helminth infection.

Here, we discuss the counter-regulatory roles of IL-22 in the murine model of CIA and present additional novel data showing that ES-62 selectively induces γδ T cells with the capacity to induce IL-22 production and that γδ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-22, but not IL-17, induced during CIA can be identified by their expression of TLR4. Moreover, we also show that treatment of mice undergoing CIA with the active PC moiety of ES-62, in the form of PC conjugated to BSA, is not only sufficient to mimic the ES-62-dependent suppression of pathogenic IL-17 responses shown previously but also that of the IL-22 and IL-10 up-regulation observed with the parasitic worm product during CIA.

Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.","title":"Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"91","weight":0.0788,"docData":{"date":"11\/05\/18","money":"911","wordCount":"168","university":"D","abstract":"Cobalt-chromium (CoCr) particles in the nanometre size range and their concomitant release of Co and Cr ions into the patients' circulation are produced by wear at the articulating surfaces of metal-on-metal (MoM) implants.

Ions released from CoCr particles derived from a resurfacing implant in vitro and their subsequent cellular up-take were measured by ICP-MS. Moreover, the ability of such metal debris and Co ions to induce both apoptosis was evaluated with both FACS and immunoblotting. qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects on the expression of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG1), nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible (NOS2), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A). ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions. There was also an increase (p < 0.05) in apoptosis after a 48 h exposure to wear debris. Analysis of qRT-PCR results found significant up-regulation (p < 0.05) particularly of NOS2 and BAG1 in Co pre-treated cells which were subsequently exposed to Co ions + debris. Metal debris was more effective as an inducer of apoptosis and gene expression when cells had been pre-treated with Co ions. This suggests that if a patient receives sequential bilateral CoCr implants, the second implant may be more likely to produce adverse effects than the first one.","title":"CoCr wear particles generated from CoCr alloy metal-on-metal hip replacements, and cobalt ions stimulate apoptosis and expression of general toxicology-related genes in monocyte-like U937 cells","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"264","weight":0.0785,"docData":{"date":"05\/02\/18","money":"772","wordCount":"106","university":"E","abstract":"The study of compressible turbulent mixing associated with Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM), Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities is motivated by diverse applications in science and engineering, including supersonic combustion, detonation, instability of collapsing gas bubbles, stratified flows in geophysical applications, chemical engineering, inertial confinement fusion (ICF), supernovae, and molecular clouds.

On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake.

Sharp corners tend to develop from concave regions of the front. The principal solution of interest has a convex front, however, so that although this solution itself has no sharp corners (except for some kinks that develop spuriously owing to errors in a numerical scheme), it is found nevertheless to exhibit milder singularities in front curvature, as the long-time asymptotic analytical solution makes clear. Numerical schemes for the evolving front shape which perform robustly (avoiding the development of spurious kinks) are also developed. Generalisations of this solution to geologically heterogeneous reservoirs should exhibit concavities and\/or sharp corner singularities as an inherent part of their evolution: propagation of fronts containing such \u2018inherent\u2019 singularities can be readily incorporated into these numerical schemes.","title":"Analysis of a model for foam improved oil recovery","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"298","weight":0.3594,"docData":{"date":"22\/11\/17","money":"552","wordCount":"64","university":"B","abstract":"Buschs theorem deriving the standard quantum probability rule can be regarded as a more general form of Gleasons theorem.

The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"283","weight":0.0472,"docData":{"date":"31\/07\/15","money":"913","wordCount":"106","university":"D","abstract":"The shallow gravity gradient in the libration point regions enables manoeuvring at low ∆v expenses, but implicates a sensitivity to small perturbations.

The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"457","weight":0.0375,"docData":{"date":"23\/03\/19","money":"392","wordCount":"80","university":"B","abstract":"We address the effect of organizational theories on the organization by focusing on how modularity, a widespread and influential organizational theory, performs a modular organization.

On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.","title":"Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"38","weight":0.0181,"docData":{"date":"17\/02\/18","money":"773","wordCount":"111","university":"B","abstract":"A number of organisms and organelles are capable of self-propulsion at the micro- and nanoscales.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"51","weight":0.02,"docData":{"date":"27\/07\/17","money":"383","wordCount":"103","university":"D","abstract":"The Scottish economy delivered strong economic growth in the first half of the year in the run up to the referendum but there are signs that growth may be beginning to slow.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically.

All movements require prospective control, an anticipation of their future effect.  This constitutes the first form of knowledge, knowing ahead of time the effects of a particular self-generated action.  At first, these are basic and simple, but over development they become serially organised into projects requiring greater knowledge of their distal consequences, as they expand in capacity and reach.

Our particular focus was on workers who could not easily afford the services of a solicitor. As such, participants were recruited through Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) who are a key provider of employment advice to this group. We tracked the experiences of workers as they sought to resolve their workplace disputes \u2013 from their initial advice sessions with CABx to the closure ( or in some cases abandonment ) of the problem. The vast majority of our participants who pursued their claims in the ET did so prior to the introduction of fees on 29 July 2013. The report focuses on the paths taken and overall outcomes for participants who were successful with their claim in the ET. It begins by providing a brief overview of the system for enforcing ET awards. The key findings from our participant group are then presented in three sections : firstly, a summary of the outcomes of our participants; secondly, experiences of those who took formal action to enforce their ET awards; and, thirdly, experiences of those who did not take formal action to enforce their ET awards.

This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines.

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"376","weight":0.1522,"docData":{"date":"24\/12\/15","money":"734","wordCount":"93","university":"B","abstract":"This report is a summary of a Learning Exchange Summit held on the 14th November 2013 in Edinburgh which provided a reflective space for those involved in residential care as policymakers, practitioners and researchers to meet together and share learning.

A full numerical description of fast electron generation and transport is found to reproduce the experimental absolute Kα yield and spot size measurements for varying target thicknesses, and to sequentially quantify the collisional and resistive electron stopping powers. The results demonstrate that both stopping mechanisms are enhanced in compressed Al samples and are attributed to the increase in the medium density and resistivity, respectively. For the achieved time- and space-averaged electronic current density, ⟨jh⟩∼8×1010\u2009A\/cm2 in the samples, the collisional and resistive stopping powers in warm and compressed Al are estimated to be 1.5\u2009keV\/μm and 0.8\u2009keV\/μm , respectively. By contrast, for cold and solid Al, the corresponding estimated values are 1.1\u2009keV\/μm and 0.6\u2009keV\/μm . Prospective numerical simulations involving higher jh show that the resistive stopping power can reach the same level as the collisional one. In addition to the effects of compression, the effect of the transient behavior of the resistivity of Al during relativistic electron beam transport becomes progressively more dominant, and for a significantly high current density, jh∼1012\u2009A\/cm2 , cancels the difference in the electron resistive stopping power (or the total stopping power in units of areal density) between solid and compressed samples. Analytical calculations extend the analysis up to jh=1014\u2009A\/cm2 (representative of the full-scale fast ignition scenario of inertial confinement fusion), where a very rapid transition to the Spitzer resistivity regime saturates the resistive stopping power, averaged over the electron beam duration, to values of ∼1\u2009keV\/μm .","title":"Unraveling resistive versus collisional contributions to relativistic electron beam stopping power in cold-solid and in warm-dense plasmas","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"633","weight":0.5758,"docData":{"date":"24\/09\/15","money":"526","wordCount":"66","university":"A","abstract":"The influence of lattice-melt-induced resistivity gradients on the transport of mega-ampere currents of fast electrons in solids is investigated numerically and experimentally using laser-accelerated protons to induce isochoric heating.

Specifically, the effect of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport is explored. The first investigation explores fast electron transport in allotropes of carbon by measuring the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of protons accelerated from the target rear-surface. An analytical model is developed which accounts for the rear-surface fast electron sheath dynamics, ionisation and projection of the resulting beam of protons, and is used (in conjunction with the experimental measurements) to infer annular fast electron beam transport with lamentary structure in 200 um-thick diamond targets. The important role that material lattice structure has in defining electrical resistivity, which in turn defines the fast electron transport properties, is established utilising three-dimensional hybrid pa rticle-in-cell (3D hybrid-PIC) simulations together with an analytical model of the resistive lamentation instability. The second investigation explores fast electron transport in silicon utilising both experimental measurements and 3D hybrid-PIC simulations. Annular fast electron transport is demonstrated and explained by resistively generated magnetic fields. The results indicate the potential to completely transform the beam transport pattern by tailoring the resistivity-temperature profile at temperatures as low as a few eV. Additionally, the sensitivity of annular fast electron beam transport is explored by varying the drive laser pulse parameters (i.e. energy, focal spot radius and pulse duration) and is found to be particularly sensitive to the peak laser pulse intensity. An ability to optically 'tune' the properties of an annular fast electron transport pattern may be important for applications. In the final investigation the effect that initial target temperature, and thus lattice melt, has on fast electron transport properties is demonstrated. Laser-accelerated proton beams are used to isochorically heat silicon for several tens-of-picoseconds prior to the propagation of fast electrons through the pre-heated target. This enables the influence of resistivity gradients, generated by proton-induced lattice melt, on fast electron transport properties to be explored. The experimental observation of an annular proton beam after t heat = 30 ps of proton pre-heating, which corresponds to annular electron transport within the target, is in excellent qualitative agreement with 3-D hybrid-PIC simulations of fast electron transport in a target containing an initial temperature (and thus, resistivity) gradient.","title":"Effects of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport in relativistic laser-solid interactions","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"586","weight":0.5625,"docData":{"date":"20\/05\/16","money":"640","wordCount":"48","university":"B","abstract":"An accurate knowledge of atomic collision processes is important for a better understanding of many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

When the plasma builds up, the radio wave is reflected at a lower altitude, and an ionization front is formed, rapidly descending to an altitude a few tens of kilometres below the initial critical layer. The ionization of the neutral gas is attributed to collisions with energetic electrons accelerated by the plasma wave turbulence. Numerical full-scale modeling of the Langmuir turbulence, electron acceleration and transport, and ionization processes are consistent with the observations.

It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"497","weight":0.2642,"docData":{"date":"07\/07\/17","money":"529","wordCount":"107","university":"B","abstract":"We combine two scanning electron microscopy techniques to investigate the influence of dislocations on the light emission from nitride semiconductors.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"644","weight":0.0406,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/16","money":"859","wordCount":"226","university":"E","abstract":"The successful miniaturization of spacecraft subsystems makes nanosatellites suitable candidates for many scientific missions, and several miniaturized electric propulsion systems on CubeSats have been studied. A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"310","weight":0.0398,"docData":{"date":"19\/11\/19","money":"179","wordCount":"155","university":"C","abstract":"The NASA N3-X blended-wing body with turboelectric distributed propulsion concept is being studied to achieve N+3 goals such as reduced noise, emissions, and improved energy efficiency.

The protection of a superconducting DC network poses unique electrical and thermal challenges due to the low impedance of the superconductor and operation in the superconducting or quenched states.  For a given TeDP electrical system architecture with fixed power ratings, conventional and solid-state circuit breakers combined with superconducting fault-current limiters are examined with both voltage and current source control to limit and interrupt the fault current.

CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.

This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results.

Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system.

Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"186","weight":0.1539,"docData":{"date":"18\/05\/17","money":"574","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"In The Changing Body (Cambridge University Press and NBER, 2011), the authors presented a series of estimates showing the number of calories available for human consumption in England and Wales at various points in time between 1700 and 1909\/13.

Energy autarky can be described as  a location that relies on its own energy  resources  for  generating  the  useful  energy  required  to  sustain  the  society  within  that region  or a situation in which a region does not import substantial amounts of energy resources. Functioning  autarkic  energy  systems  typically  require  a  micro-grid,  well  understood  energy demand and supply characteristics, opportunities for energy storage of various types and controls able to  manage the harmonisation of system components. A critical additional ingredient is users who can work within constraints created by the adoption of autarkic principles.  To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in \ndelivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments.

Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells.

However, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are complex diseases that require tailored treatments. Consequently, generally there have been limited demand-side measures by health authorities to encourage the preferential prescribing of generics. This is unlike the situation with hypertension, hypercholaesterolaemia or acid-related stomach disorders.The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the limited demand-side measures in Western European countries and regions on the subsequent prescribing of risperidone following generics; to utilise the findings to provide future guidance to health authorities; and where possible, to investigate the utilisation of generic versus originator risperidone and the prices for generic risperidone.\n\nPrincipally, this was a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series data of the effect of the various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).\n\nThere was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland. Similarly, the price of generic risperidone varied considerably. In Scotland, generic risperidone was only 16% of pre-patent loss prices versus 72% in Ireland.\n\nConsistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.","title":"Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? findings from across Europe and their implications","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"600","weight":0.0327,"docData":{"date":"12\/06\/15","money":"849","wordCount":"92","university":"A","abstract":"The value of the customer has been widely recognized in terms of financial planning and efficient resource allocation including the financial service industry.

The operation procedures, including maintenance and disposal practices, of the constellations currently deployed were analyzed in order to asses a proper reference simulation scenario.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":16.0,"label":"resource"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"opportunity"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"region"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"ppe"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"exploitation"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"network"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"balance"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"sexual"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"england"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"characteristic"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"model"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"paper"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"allocation"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"nowcasting"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"wale"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"complexity"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"nowcast"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"hold"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"deliver"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"complex"}],"topicIndex":28,"mainTopicIds":["18","12","4"]},{"topicId":"29","topDocs":[{"docId":"77","weight":0.6809,"docData":{"date":"20\/06\/15","money":"924","wordCount":"94","university":"B","abstract":"Quantum properties of correlations have a key role in disparate fields of physics, from quantum information processing, to quantum foundations, to strongly correlated systems.

We prove that strictly classical bipartite correlations may still require global entanglement and that unentangled---albeit not strictly classical---reductions may require global genuine multipartite entanglement, rather than simple entanglement. On the other hand, for three qubits, the strict classicality of the bipartite reductions rules out the need for genuine multipartite entanglement.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems.

Deriving and solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with fermions.","title":"Light scattering and dissipative dynamics of many fermionic atoms in an optical lattice","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"700","weight":0.1539,"docData":{"date":"14\/09\/19","money":"689","wordCount":"79","university":"A","abstract":"We study the big-bucket capacitated lot sizing problem with setup times.

Distributions of ten representative zooplankton taxa, from recent (2000-2009) Continuous Plankton Recorder data, are presented, along with basin-scale patterns of annual sea surface temperature and phytoplankton color.  The distribution patterns represent the manifestation of very different physiological, life history and ecological interactions of each taxon with the North Atlantic habitat characteristics. The paper then focuses on a pan-Atlantic compilation of demographic and life history information for the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, perhaps one of the most ecologically important and certainly the most studied zooplankton species in the North Atlantic. Abundance, dormancy, egg production and mortality in relation to temperature and phytoplankton biomass, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, are analyzed in the context of understanding factors involved in determining the distribution and abundance of C. finmarchicus across its range. Several themes emerge:  (1)  transport of C. finmarchicus is from the south to the north in the northeast Atlantic, but from the north to the south in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses to climate forcing on coastal shelves, , (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east while it occurs after the bloom in many western sites, (3) while the deep basins in the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea are primary sources of C. finmarchicus production,  the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the western North Atlantic shelves, (4) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production responses, (5) differences in functional responses in egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (6) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, and (7) differences in stage-specific mortality rates are related to bathymetry, temperature and potential predators, notably the abundance of congeners Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis, which likely feed on early life stages of C. finmarchicus. Two modeling approaches have previously been used to interpret the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in relation to the North Atlantic habitat. A statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical modeling approach, based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history and implemented by recent developments in coupled physical-life cycle modeling. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. A synthesis of the two modeling approaches to predict North Atlantic zooplankton species shifts, not only for C. finmarchicus, but also for other major taxa, is advocated. While the computational resource requirements and lack of species-specific life history information for physical-biological modeling hinder full application for many zooplankton taxa, use of the approach, where possible, to understand advective influences will provide insight for interpretation of statistical predictions from species distribution models.","title":"The North Atlantic Ocean as habitat for Calanus finmarchicus: environmental factors and life history traits","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"285","weight":0.3631,"docData":{"date":"27\/02\/19","money":"160","wordCount":"157","university":"B","abstract":"Temperature is hypothesized to contribute to increased pathogenicity and virulence of many marine diseases. The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake.

However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks. Our results highlight the importance of considering the broader ecosystem consequences of fishery management policy, since species interactions may dissipate or negate intended benefits.","title":"Cascading ecological effects of eliminating fishery discards","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"378","weight":0.0487,"docData":{"date":"10\/04\/18","money":"149","wordCount":"149","university":"D","abstract":"Marine invertebrate-associated symbiotic bacteria produce a plethora of novel secondary metabolites which may be structurally unique with interesting pharmacological properties. Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp. ZS402 and Vibrio splendidus strain LGP32, to prioritize for scale-up based on their chemically interesting secondary metabolomes, established through dereplication and interesting bioactivities, determined from bioassay screening.","title":"Metabolomic tools for secondary metabolite discovery from marine microbial symbionts","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"446","weight":0.0393,"docData":{"date":"08\/11\/15","money":"449","wordCount":"102","university":"D","abstract":"Leading firms in energy and transport production seek to make ethanol a \u2018global commodity\u2019 and stretch their operations across spatial boundaries.

Statistical analysis revealed that resistant bacteria, in most cases, were spread by the same route in almost all slaughterhouse zones, except for tetB, blaCTX and blaTEM genes, which occurred in few zones as isolated 'hot spots'. The sum of all analyzed ARG indicated that slaughterhouse surfaces and end products act as reservoirs of ARG, mainly tet genes, which were more prevalent in slaughtering room (SR), cutting room (CR) and commercial meat products (MP).

This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand \ndata gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional \ngeneration available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from \nwind and wave sources.","title":"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"161","weight":0.5854,"docData":{"date":"08\/03\/18","money":"416","wordCount":"124","university":"D","abstract":"Abstract In the last decade, the EU has driven forward the development and connection of renewable power sources across Europe. This has changed the way in which distribution networks operate, moving from a passive system, to a more active system where generation and demand are located closer together with system states being more complex and variable. Increased penetration of renewable generation into distribution networks is presenting a number of challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) including the provision of network access in capacity constrained networks. The introduction of Active Network Management (ANM) is enabling an increase in renewable generation connections through enhanced network access in otherwise \u2018full\u2019 networks.

In this paper, a comprehensive literature review, detailed case study evaluation on early ANM schemes, quantitative curtailment assessment for different PoA and a qualitative analysis of business models for different ANM PoA is presented in turn with conclusions drawn from these three approaches.","title":"A review and analysis of renewable energy curtailment schemes and Principles of Access: transitioning towards business as usual","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"488","weight":0.5157,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"198","wordCount":"129","university":"E","abstract":"Many countries around the world are challenged to meet the escalating demand for power often resulting in frequent blackouts. Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.","title":"Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"703","weight":0.5154,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/19","money":"577","wordCount":"131","university":"D","abstract":"With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and  renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins.

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply\u2013demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key.","title":"Linking a storyline with multiple models: a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"115","weight":0.4174,"docData":{"date":"19\/03\/19","money":"929","wordCount":"231","university":"A","abstract":"When  visioning  for  best  possible  future  energy  systems  in  a  world  with  growing  populations, limited  fossil  fuel  resources,  rising  energy  prices  and  less  energy  security  -  more  individuals, communities and cities are looking to utilise autarkic principles to harvest, store and optimise use of  local energy resources. Energy autarky can be described as  a location that relies on its own energy  resources  for  generating  the  useful  energy  required  to  sustain  the  society  within  that region  or a situation in which a region does not import substantial amounts of energy resources. Functioning  autarkic  energy  systems  typically  require  a  micro-grid,  well  understood  energy demand and supply characteristics, opportunities for energy storage of various types and controls able to  manage the harmonisation of system components. A critical additional ingredient is users who can work within constraints created by the adoption of autarkic principles.  To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in \ndelivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments.

Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased.

At low sampling rates, in the order of minutes, NALM is a difficult problem, due to significant random noise, unknown base load, many household appliances that have similar power signatures, and the fact that most domestic appliances (for example, microwave, toaster), have usual operation of just over a minute. In this paper, we proposed a different NALM approach to more traditional approaches, by representing the dataset of active power signatures using a graph signal. We develop a regularization on graph approach where by maximizing smoothness of the underlying graph signal, we are able to perform disaggregation. Simulation results using publicly available REDD dataset demonstrate potential of the GSP for energy disaggregation and competitive performance with respect to more complex Hidden Markov Model-based approaches.","title":"A graph-based signal processing approach for low-rate energy disaggregation","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"93","weight":0.22,"docData":{"date":"07\/04\/15","money":"576","wordCount":"100","university":"A","abstract":"Recent years have seen a rapid growth in demand for ultra high speed data transmission with end users expecting fast, high bandwidth network access. With this rapid growth in demand, data centres are under pressure to provide ever increasing data rates through their networks and at the same time improve the quality of data handling in terms of reduced latency, increased scalability and improved channel speed for users. However as data rates increase, present technology based on well-established CMOS technology is becoming increasingly difficult to scale and consequently data networks are struggling to satisfy current network demand. In this paper the interrelated issues of electronic scalability, power consumption, limited copper interconnect bandwidth and the limited speed of CMOS electronics will be explored alongside the tremendous bandwidth potential of optical fibre based photonic networks.

This paper reviews Scottish energy strategy since 1999 and notes the stronger policy link in recent years between investment in low carbon and renewable energy and related employment growth. The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

Traditional investment analysis methods are considered marginally useful to analyse this case. Instead, the recent tools of time-dependent investment analysis are more appropriate, since they are not inherently restricted to immediate, irreversible decisions. In the present work, a time-dependent computational model is presented and applied in the case study of the Greek Power Sector, in order to estimate the potential advantages of the fuel switching concept. Moreover, the optimal timing of switching is derived, to ensure increasing yields of an average-capacity power-plant. The results of the research indicate significant financial benefits anticipated in most scenarios from applying fuel switching, compared to single-fuelled electricity generation units.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. \nTo address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. \nThe SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper. Compared with the existing process, the new process is significantly streamlined, and permits an IED-independent system configuration tool to carry out the entire configuration process. No proprietary software or communications are needed. It also allows the protection settings to be performed at a system level, rather than individually on a \u201Cper device\u201D basis. \nThe key challenges that must be addressed in order for the proposed process to be widely adopted are: the IEC 61850 data model for protection settings is not complete; vendors may prefer to maintain proprietary formats; the data model should have the capability to be extended for future protection functions.

However, a severe bottleneck is how to compute the PCA covariance matrix efficiently and avoid computational difficulties, especially when the spatial dimension of the hypercube is large. In this paper, structured covariance PCA (SC-PCA) is proposed for fast computation of the covariance matrix. In line with how spectral data is acquired in either the push-broom or tunable filter way, different implementation schemes of SC-PCA are presented. As the proposed SC-PCA can determine the covariance matrix from partial covariance matrices in parallel even without deducting the mean vector in prior, it facilitates real-time data analysis whilst the hypercube is acquired. This has significantly reduced the scale of required memory and also allows efficient onsite feature extraction and data reduction to benefit subsequent tasks in coding\/compression, transmission, and analytics of hyperspectral data.","title":"Structured covariance principal component analysis for real-time onsite feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"732","weight":0.4,"docData":{"date":"01\/03\/16","money":"901","wordCount":"73","university":"D","abstract":"Consumer perception of beef quality has been shown to be largely dependent upon three factors, which are tenderness, juiciness and flavour.

Our knowledge on this interaction is based mainly on fMRI studies, but there is little direct evidence on how these changes manifest in terms of dynamic neuronal activity. This study reports on the presence of transient EEG based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyse dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronisation in the theta, alpha and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both non-painful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronisation during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.","title":"Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"593","weight":0.0124,"docData":{"date":"29\/05\/15","money":"958","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"We consider the nonequilibrium dynamics of a driven dissipative spin chain with chiral coupling to a one-dimensional (1D) bosonic bath, and its atomic implementation with a two-species mixture of cold quantum gases.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"331","weight":0.0093,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/15","money":"620","wordCount":"108","university":"C","abstract":"In performance-based earthquake engineering, fragility curves constitute an essential component, providing a probabilistic link between the earthquake intensity measure and the structural response, expressed as an engineering demand parameter. In this study, we apply a capacity spectrum method that uses inelastic response spectra derived from earthquake accelerograms to construct fragility curves for an example reinforced concrete structure. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations). A variant of the peak-to-trough measure introduced by Stafford and Bommer (2010) provides a useful way of measuring the variability in the input spectra.","title":"Investigating the use of record-to-record variability in static capacity approaches","authors":"H & L"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":44.0,"label":"data"},{"weight":26.0,"label":"protection"},{"weight":20.0,"label":"hyperspectral"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"process"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"setting"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"detection"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"extraction"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"iec"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"pca"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"paper"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"proprietary"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"hsi"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"file"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"imaging"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"configuration"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"scl"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"spectral"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"application"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"beef"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"imagery"}],"topicIndex":32,"mainTopicIds":["0","10","16"]},{"topicId":"33","topDocs":[{"docId":"83","weight":0.577,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/17","money":"318","wordCount":"52","university":"D","abstract":"We examine a trade model where three countries compete for an exogenous number of firms.

Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their \u2018feet on the ground\u2019 where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for \u2018generation bagging\u2019  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.  We contribute to heritage tourism studies by revealing how extensive and well preserved archives, local knowledge and a passion for family history can serve to generate unique and deeply emotional tourism experiences for ancestral tourists. Despite the often \u2018cottage industry\u2019 nature of many ancestral attractions (often reliant on volunteers and local \u2018good will) the outcome of the visit can often be greater satisfaction and a strong repeat visitation pattern.","title":"Connecting with the past: meeting the needs of ancestral tourists in Scotland","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"456","weight":0.3538,"docData":{"date":"06\/02\/15","money":"387","wordCount":"150","university":"A","abstract":"Existing research on the phenomenon of economy-wide rebound effects from increased energy efficiency have identified the importance of trade effects determining the nature and magnitude of economywide rebound effects in national economies where efficiency improvements have occurred (e.g. Hanley et al., 2009; Van den Bergh, 2011). However, the issue of potential spillover effects on energy demand (and supply) from energy efficiency improvements in one region\/nation on others have generally been neglected (Madlener and Alcott, 2009; Sorrell, 2009; Turner, 2013; Van den Bergh, 2011).

While basic theoretical contributions on the issue of \u2018global rebound\u2019 have been made (e.g. Wei, 2010) and some applied studies have been conducted (e.g. Barker et al., 2009), there exist no applied macro-level rebound studies to date that attempt to fully consider and identify the types of channels through which energy efficiency increases in one region\/nation may impact energy demand and supply conditions in others. This is an important knowledge gap, particularly given the global nature of energy-related climate change and the context of supra-national policy targets such as the EU 20-20-20 framework. The potential for energy efficiency policy actions taken in one country to impact energy use (and related emissions) in others implies that target setting and implementation decisions in different member states may not be regarded as independent.","title":"Beyond national economy-wide rebound effects: an applied general equilibrium analysis incorporating international spillover effects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"660","weight":0.3334,"docData":{"date":"13\/05\/16","money":"383","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Research into consumer ethnicity is a vital discipline that has substantially evolved in the past three decades.

Of course, learner understanding transcends the mathematical curriculum per se, but the significance of mathematical understanding for competent functioning exemplifies the imperative of teaching for understanding or 'deep learning'. The essay begins with some conceptual 'ground clearing' to establish mathematical understanding as a neglected issue.  It then considers what mathematical understanding is, why it is important, the increasingly important role of metacognition, and the very necessary role of teachers. At each of these points, implications for pedagogical practice are raised.","title":"Articulating 'understanding': deploying mathematical metacognition","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"479","weight":0.0544,"docData":{"date":"26\/07\/19","money":"819","wordCount":"95","university":"C","abstract":"Lectin-like bacteriocins consist of tandem monocot mannose-binding domains and display a genus-specific killing activity. Here we show that pyocin L1, a novel member of this family from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, targets susceptible strains of this species through recognition of the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide that is predominantly a homopolymer of d-rhamnose. Structural and biophysical analyses show that recognition of CPA occurs through the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain of pyocin L1 and that this interaction is a prerequisite for bactericidal activity. Further to this, we show that the previously described lectin-like bacteriocin putidacin L1 shows a similar carbohydrate-binding specificity, indicating that oligosaccharides containing d-rhamnose and not d-mannose, as was previously thought, are the physiologically relevant ligands for this group of bacteriocins. The widespread inclusion of d-rhamnose in the lipopolysaccharide of members of the genus Pseudomonas explains the unusual genus-specific activity of the lectin-like bacteriocins.","title":"Lectin-like bacteriocins from pseudomonas spp. utilise D-rhamnose containing lipopolysaccharide as a cellular receptor","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"603","weight":0.0435,"docData":{"date":"18\/03\/18","money":"541","wordCount":"69","university":"D","abstract":"The integration of low carbon energy systems with zero carbon housing and communities requires a detailed understanding of the scale and timing of energy demand.

Viewing place as a symbolic part of the consumption process, a \"Model of Festival Place\" is developed. This advances theories that presuppose environment as nothing more than a context for consumption. Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"339","weight":0.4325,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/16","money":"384","wordCount":"37","university":"C","abstract":"This article puts forward an economic case for Scotland staying in the union.

Empirical data suggests that it is possible to provide countless examples of observed open innovation activity. However, these are not necessarily a direct cause of strategic intent towards implementing \nopen innovation. Findings also show that if open innovation is to become a professionally managed activity, research needs to be aligned towards strategy of the firm.

Another unique feature is that the journal since the beginning was, and still is, made available for free without subscription fees or publishing fees. A third feature of Archnet-IJAR is the opportunity it offers to young academics, PhD scholars, reaching across the boundaries of cultures and regions.\n\nKey highlights in the past seven years are important to note. In qualitative and quantitative terms the journal has made significant achievements. In terms of quality the journal became part of important data and index bases including Avery index to Architectural Periodicals, EBSCO-Current Abstracts-Art and Architecture, INTUTE, Directory of Open Access Journals, Pro-Quest, Scopus-Elsevier and many university library databases.

Doing so is regarded as a way of meeting individual needs and improving academic standards. Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective \u2013 and potentially antagonistic - social identities.","title":"Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"584","weight":0.3847,"docData":{"date":"22\/07\/19","money":"838","wordCount":"69","university":"E","abstract":"This article reviews the diverse state of economic recovery across the Euro area and across the UK.

The emergence of the implied obligation of mutual trust and confidence can be portrayed as confirming the validity of that dichotomy. It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services. The relevance of the emergence of the concept of the relational contract is addressed.","title":"Fair dealing and the world of work","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"468","weight":0.3774,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/15","money":"666","wordCount":"53","university":"E","abstract":"This paper gives a brief overview of the current system of supporting young people who enter into secure care or custody in Scotland to reintegrate and transition back into their families and communities.

The presentation discusses initial findings from fieldwork conducted in a school in the United Kingdom, which researched young people\u2019s conceptions of political information, how they interact with information sources and how this relates to their sense of political agency. The research sought a\ndeep understanding of the topic and took a phenomenographic approach.

The research is working towards recommendations to contribute to the development of a critical approach to information literacy instruction, which will make recommendations as to how educators supporting young people\u2019s information literacy can engage with the cultural and contextual needs of their learners through the methodological and theoretical approaches taken in this research.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"343","weight":0.1892,"docData":{"date":"17\/04\/19","money":"157","wordCount":"80","university":"C","abstract":"The light absorption coefficient of water is dependent on temperature and concentration of ions, i.e. the salinity in seawater.

PL spectra at different excitation laser powers and temperatures were measured for as-grown as well as compressed samples. The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation. The compression increases the intensity of energy bands by an order of magnitude and reduces the j-shift, demonstrating an improvement of the electronic properties.","title":"Effect of mechanical compression on Cu(In,Ga)Se films: micro-structural and photoluminescence analysis","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"26","weight":0.0706,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/19","money":"228","wordCount":"167","university":"D","abstract":"The distribution and quantification of tetracycline, sulfonamide and beta-lactam\nresistance genes were assessed in slaughterhouse zones throughout meat chain\nproduction and the meat products; this study represents the first to report quantitatively monitor antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in goat and lamb slaughterhouse using a culture independent approach, since most studies focused on individual bacterial species and their specific resistance types.

Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous.

Thus, a clear majority of data users find the \u201CTaranis\u201D orbit concept to be better than a critical inclination orbit, due to the improved perspective offered. The geophysical products that would benefit from a GEO-like polar platform are mainly estimated from radiances in the visible\/near infrared and thermal parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is consistent with currently proven technologies from GEO. Based on the survey results, needs analysis, and current technology proven from GEO, scientific and observation requirements are developed along with two instrument concepts with eight and four channels, based on Flexible Combined Imager heritage.

However, it suffers from the low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, only half of the DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement).

PiC\ncode simulations have been undertaken to investigate the dynamics of the cyclotron emission process in the absence of cavity boundaries with particular consideration of the spatial growth rate, spectral output and rf conversion efficiency. Computations reveal that a well-defined cyclotron emission process occurs albeit with a low spatial growth rate compared to waveguide bounded simulations. The rf output is near perpendicular to the electron beam with a slight backward-wave character reflected in the spectral output with a well defined peak at 2.68GHz, just below the relativistic electron cyclotron frequency. The corresponding rf conversion efficiency of 1.1% is comparable to waveguide bounded simulations and consistent with the predictions of kinetic theory that suggest efficient, spectrally well defined radiation emission can be obtained from an electron horseshoe distribution in the absence of radiation boundaries.","title":"Numerical simulation of unconstrained cyclotron resonant maser emission","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"525","weight":0.0639,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/18","money":"702","wordCount":"100","university":"D","abstract":"Abstract Thin films of p-type Cu3BiS3 with an orthorhombic wittichenite structure, a semiconductor with high potential for thin film solar cell absorber layers, were synthesised by thermal annealing of Cu and Bi precursors, magnetron sputtered on Mo\/glass substrate, with a layer of thermo-evaporated S.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"350","weight":0.0064,"docData":{"date":"05\/04\/17","money":"474","wordCount":"184","university":"B","abstract":"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate size-tuneable polymeric glycol-chitosan (GC)-DTPAGadolinium (Gd) conjugates as MRI contrast agents that can be used as a platform for imaging of molecular weight (MW) dependent transport processes.

GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD). The kidneys showed early enhancement also, particularly in the renal pelvis, suggesting renal elimination. Imaging of the head with GC-DTPA-Gd allowed detailed anatomical identification of specific blood vessels in particular with the high MW CA agent. Sequential, high-resolution, isotropic imaging of established A431 xenograft flank tumours with DTPA-Gd and GC-DTPA-Gd demonstrated that the initial distribution of the contrast agents was well correlated with blood vessels and supply. In contrast, subsequent tissue transport was primarily by diffusion and limited by CA molecular weight. The data also highlight the role of heterogeneity in CA distribution which was more prominent for the high MW agent.

CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"646","weight":0.3419,"docData":{"date":"07\/08\/19","money":"209","wordCount":"119","university":"D","abstract":"A vortex ring is a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop.

The algorithm translates the design of an MGA transfer into a planning and scheduling process in which each planetary encounter is seen as a scheduled task. All possible transfers form a directional graph that is incrementally built and explored simultaneously forward from the departure planet to the arrival one and backward from the arrival planet to the departure one. Nodes in the graph (or tree) represent tasks (or planetary encounters). Backward and forward generated transfers are then matched during the construction of the tree to improve both convergence and exploration. It can be shown, in fact, that the multi-directional exploration of the tree, allows for better quality solutions for the same computational cost. Unlike branch and prune algorithms that use a set of deterministic branching and pruning heuristics, the algorithm proposed in this paper progressively builds a probabilistic model over all the possible tasks that form a complete trajectory. No branch is pruned but the probability of selecting one particular task increases as the algorithm progresses in the search for a solution.

When compared to onshore wind, O&M costs are increased, due to the use of specialised vessels, shorter weather windows and challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of offshore wind industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus of this paper is to provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the offshore wind farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations. The developed methodology and analysis enable operators to decide the specification of CTVs which will bring the optimum financial benefit, considering both the enhancement of the offshore wind farm power generation as well as the minimisation of the total O&M cost.","title":"Optimum CTV fleet selection for offshore wind farm O&M activities","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"741","weight":0.1,"docData":{"date":"06\/11\/16","money":"418","wordCount":"30","university":"D","abstract":"The Project Macmillan Exploratory aimed to discover how asthma care could benefit from augmented reality by reviewing existing evidence (patient surveys, professional feedback, etc.) and discussing the future direction of asthma treatment, including how to further develop adherence behaviour.","title":"Project Macmillan Exploratory Report","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"229","weight":0.0793,"docData":{"date":"10\/02\/19","money":"889","wordCount":"101","university":"C","abstract":"The aim of the Gathering the Voices project is to gather testimonies from Holocaust survivors who have made their home in Scotland and to make these testimonies available on the World Wide Web.

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.

While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"91","weight":0.0182,"docData":{"date":"11\/05\/18","money":"911","wordCount":"168","university":"D","abstract":"Cobalt-chromium (CoCr) particles in the nanometre size range and their concomitant release of Co and Cr ions into the patients' circulation are produced by wear at the articulating surfaces of metal-on-metal (MoM) implants.

Ions released from CoCr particles derived from a resurfacing implant in vitro and their subsequent cellular up-take were measured by ICP-MS. Moreover, the ability of such metal debris and Co ions to induce both apoptosis was evaluated with both FACS and immunoblotting. qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects on the expression of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG1), nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible (NOS2), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A). ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions. There was also an increase (p < 0.05) in apoptosis after a 48 h exposure to wear debris.

We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks.

Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives. The decrease in acquisition risk post-SOX cannot be solely attributed to changes in the structure of executive compensation but it additionally stems from the way managers perceive compensation-based incentives in the new regulatory environment.

Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010).

The chirality of reservoir excitations allows the spins to couple differently to left- and right-moving modes, which in our atomic setup can be tuned from bidirectional to purely unidirectional. Remarkably, this leads to a pure steady state in which pairs of neighboring spins form dimers that decouple from the remainder of the chain.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"409","weight":0.0112,"docData":{"date":"24\/09\/17","money":"811","wordCount":"98","university":"C","abstract":"This project is partly supported by NSFC Grant 51207146, RAEng Research Exchange scheme of UK and EPSRC EP\/K01496X\/1.

Effective treatment relies on the availability of sensitive methods to characterise the problem. Rhythm metrics based on segmental durations originally designed for crosslinguistic research have the potential to provide such information. However, these measures may be associated with problems that impact on their clinical usefulness. This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech.  The paper concludes that the underlying speech impairment leading to the perceptual and acoustic characterisation of rhythmic problems needs to be established through detailed analysis of speech characteristics in order to construct effective treatment plans for individuals with speech disorders.","title":"Quantification of rhythm problems in disordered speech: a re-evaluation","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"466","weight":0.375,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/16","money":"441","wordCount":"40","university":"D","abstract":"Sonic properties of spider silks are measured independent of the web using laser vibrometry and ballistic impact providing insights into Nature's design of functionalized high-performance materials.

Overexpression of either gene resulted in faster hexose catabolism, but no cumulative effect was observed with the simultaneous overexpression. The improved phenotype of MCR1 overexpression appeared to be related, at least in part, to a faster furaldehyde reduction capacity, indicating that this reductase may have a wider substrate range than previously reported.

Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased.

The study examined a wide range of process parameters; from this, a preliminary process parameter envelope has been developed and initial process parameter sets established that produce commercially attractive excellent quality welds through a substantial increase in the conventionally recognised weld traverse speed.","title":"Development of a process envelope for friction stir welding of DH36 steel: a step change","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"740","weight":0.3334,"docData":{"date":"13\/02\/19","money":"100","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated to quantify the social impact an individual has on his\/her community when he\/she performs any energy efficiency project and transmits that information to his\/her neighbours.

We use Gleeson's et al., Phys. Rev. E80, 036107 (2009) algorithm to create clustered networks in which a proportion of individuals is located in fully-connected cliques of certain size. A SIR model is extended to include delayed and imperfect detection of infectious individuals. We also include a combination of responsive (palliative) and preventive (vaccination) treatments and design cost-effective disease control strategies. Cost-benefit analysis is used in combination with epidemiological simulations to identify an optimal radius for a treatment centred upon the symptomatic individual. Three general control strategies occur depending on the relative cost of treatment and prevention. Network topology and, in particular, clustering also affects the applicability of the control strategy. The average path length appears to be more important; the range for the control strategy is wider with the length, but the optimal radius of control also extends. As the proportion of individuals in cliques and therefore the coefficient of clustering is higher, the range of the costs for which control scenario is optimal is greater. This results have important consequences for designing disease control strategies that also satisfy economic optimality criteria.","title":"Cost-benefit analysis of epidemics spreading on clustered random networks","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"718","weight":0.3266,"docData":{"date":"01\/09\/19","money":"471","wordCount":"151","university":"B","abstract":"Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the range from 100-250 MeV have the potential of becoming an alternative modality in radiotherapy because of their improved dosimetry properties compared with MV photons from contemporary medical linear accelerators. Due to the need for accurate dosimetry of small field size VHEE beams we have performed dose measurements using EBT2 Gafchromic® film. Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response. Neutron and proton contribution to the equivalent doses are negligible for VHEE. The study demonstrates that EBT2 Gafchromic film is a reliable dosimeter that can be used for dosimetry of VHEE. The results indicate an energy-independent response of the dosimeter for 20 MeV and 165 MeV electron beams and has been found to be suitable for dosimetry of VHEE.","title":"Dosimetry of very high energy electrons (VHEE) for radiotherapy applications: using radiochromic film measurements and Monte Carlo simulations","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"285","weight":0.3249,"docData":{"date":"27\/02\/19","money":"160","wordCount":"157","university":"B","abstract":"Temperature is hypothesized to contribute to increased pathogenicity and virulence of many marine diseases. The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies.","title":"Modelling the impact of temperature-induced life history plasticity and mate limitation on the epidemic potential of a marine ectoparasite","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"283","weight":0.3208,"docData":{"date":"31\/07\/15","money":"913","wordCount":"106","university":"D","abstract":"The shallow gravity gradient in the libration point regions enables manoeuvring at low ∆v expenses, but implicates a sensitivity to small perturbations.

In this paper, a station-keeping algorithm based on the orbital lifetime expectancy is proposed for so-called quasi-periodic solutions. The method introduced is based on the identification of a manoeuvre maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations).

The buckling analysis includes a first order shear deformation theory by introducing additional shape functions for transverse shear and is therefore applicable to structures with thick skins relative to characteristic length. Modelling of the stiffener is achieved with two approaches; idealisation as a beam attached to the skin\u2019s midplane and as a rigidly attached plate. Comparing results with finite element analysis (Abaqus) for selected case studies, local buckling errors for the beam model and plate model were found to be less than 3% and 2% respectively, whilst the beam model error for global buckling was between 3% and 10%. The analytical model provides an accurate alternative to the computationally expensive finite element analysis and is therefore suitable for future work on the design and optimisation of stiffened VAT panels.","title":"Buckling analysis of stiffened variable angle tow panels","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"549","weight":0.076,"docData":{"date":"05\/10\/15","money":"875","wordCount":"79","university":"A","abstract":"A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based structure capable of operating mechanically as a directional acoustical sensor is presented.

The investigation of three faults is also conducted analytically and experimentally and maintenance suggestions are also provided for different fault types. The proposed methodology is developed to combine the electrical and thermal characteristics of PV cells subjected to different fault mechanisms through simulation and experimental tests.

A fault-location estimation algorithm, using the data measured during various system states and is capable of locating the fault types involving one fault resistance (i.e., single-line-to-ground fault or line-to-line fault), is developed and presented. The proposed fault-location technique is shown to have high accuracy; results are presented and compared with the well-established Takagi method and the performance of the algorithm is analyzed and discussed. The proposed technique can reduce or negate limitations associated with conventional single-ended methods and can also estimate other factors associated with the fault (e.g., fault resistance and remote source impedance). In addition, it is a potentially economic solution, since it is relatively straightforward to implement on a standard protection relay hardware platform. The proposed method is demonstrated using Electromagnetic Transients Program\/Alternate Transients Program simulation models for a variety of different cases.

However, it suffers from the low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, only half of the DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system.

The simulation results reveal that high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) in silicon (Si-I to Si-II phase transformation) occurred in all cases; however, its extent and the manner in which it occurred differed significantly between polycrystalline silicon and single crystal silicon, and was the main driver of differences in the nanoindentation deformation behaviour between these two types of silicon. Interestingly, in polycrystalline silicon, the HPPT was observed to occur more preferentially along the grain boundaries than across the grain boundaries. An automated dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA) revealed no dislocations in the deformation zone, suggesting that HPPT is the primary mechanism in inducing plasticity in silicon.","title":"Nanoindentation of polysiliocn and single crystal silicon: molecular dynamics simulation and experimental validation","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"329","weight":0.0255,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/19","money":"236","wordCount":"157","university":"A","abstract":"The last decade has seen a huge increase in the amount of \u201Comics\u201D data available and in our ability to interpret those data. The aim of this paper is to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"696","weight":0.0102,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/16","money":"349","wordCount":"99","university":"A","abstract":"This investigation considers a methodology for analysis of the vibratory response of composite laminate structures which is based on Singular Spectrum Analysis. Composite laminate structures generally demonstrate nonlinear dynamic behaviour as a result of their intrinsic material nonlinear nature.

The variation of these parameters can produce radical changes on the clustering effect of the methodology and it is demonstrated that this might affect the results interpretation.","title":"Singular spectrum analysis  for identifying structural nonlinearity using free-decay responses: Application detection and diagnosis in composite laminates","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"703","weight":0.0077,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/19","money":"577","wordCount":"131","university":"D","abstract":"With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and  renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins.

Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed lambda-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F.  This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity.","title":"A relationally parametric model of dependent type theory","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"341","weight":0.7632,"docData":{"date":"26\/02\/16","money":"361","wordCount":"114","university":"D","abstract":"Invariance is of paramount importance in programming languages and in physics. In programming languages, John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields \"free\" theorems about programs just from their types. In physics, Emmy Noether showed that if the action of a physical system is invariant under change of coordinates, then the physical system has a conserved quantity: a quantity that remains constant for all time. Knowledge of conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems. For example, the conservation of energy is by Noether's theorem a consequence of a system's invariance under time-shifting.\n\nIn this paper, we link Reynolds' relational parametricity with Noether's theorem for deriving conserved quantities. We propose an extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms of their Lagrangians. We show, by constructing a relationally parametric model of our extension of Fω, that relational parametricity is enough to satisfy the hypotheses of Noether's theorem, and so to derive conserved quantities for free, directly from the polymorphic types of Lagrangians expressed in our system.","title":"From parametricity to conservation laws, via Noether's Theorem","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"537","weight":0.695,"docData":{"date":"25\/11\/15","money":"554","wordCount":"61","university":"B","abstract":"We present a (co)algebraic treatment of iteration-free dynamic modal logics such as Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) and Game Logic (GL), both without star.

Using these functional ornaments, we capture the relationship between functions such as the addition of natural numbers and the concatenation of lists. With this knowledge, we demonstrate how the implementation of the former informs the implementation of the latter: The users can ask the definition of addition to be lifted to lists and they will only be asked the details necessary to carry on adding lists rather than numbers.

Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"37","weight":0.3564,"docData":{"date":"12\/06\/17","money":"554","wordCount":"87","university":"B","abstract":"I present a datatype-generic treatment of recursive container types whose elements are guaranteed to be stored in increasing order, with the ordering invariant rolled out systematically.

The first heuristic algorithm arranges new tasks by inserting or deleting them, then inserting them repeatedly according to the priority from low to high, which is named IDI algorithm. The second one called ISDR adopts four steps: insert directly, insert by shifting, insert by deleting, and reinsert the tasks deleted. Moreover, two heuristic factors, congestion degree of a time window and the overlapping degree of a task, are employed to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance. Finally, a case is given to test the algorithms.

The algorithm translates the design of an MGA transfer into a planning and scheduling process in which each planetary encounter is seen as a scheduled task. All possible transfers form a directional graph that is incrementally built and explored simultaneously forward from the departure planet to the arrival one and backward from the arrival planet to the departure one. Nodes in the graph (or tree) represent tasks (or planetary encounters). Backward and forward generated transfers are then matched during the construction of the tree to improve both convergence and exploration. It can be shown, in fact, that the multi-directional exploration of the tree, allows for better quality solutions for the same computational cost. Unlike branch and prune algorithms that use a set of deterministic branching and pruning heuristics, the algorithm proposed in this paper progressively builds a probabilistic model over all the possible tasks that form a complete trajectory. No branch is pruned but the probability of selecting one particular task increases as the algorithm progresses in the search for a solution.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language.

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability.

The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0.

Experiments are comprehensively conducted on all of the 58 instances with small, medium, and large scales in the Operation Research Library (OR-library). The results confirm that BVDPSO can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly since it only needs to generate a few multicast trees.

The average path length appears to be more important; the range for the control strategy is wider with the length, but the optimal radius of control also extends. As the proportion of individuals in cliques and therefore the coefficient of clustering is higher, the range of the costs for which control scenario is optimal is greater.

The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.","title":"'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"573","weight":0.0035,"docData":{"date":"16\/12\/17","money":"673","wordCount":"288","university":"A","abstract":"Solar sails have long been considered as a means of enabling new high-energy missions, such as solar polar orbiter, planetary sample return and heliopause probes, along with families of highly non-Keplerian orbits for space weather and Earth observation missions, as reviewed in Refs 1 and 2.  While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":34.0,"label":"algorithm"},{"weight":28.0,"label":"problem"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"trajectory"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"propose"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"optimization"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"computational"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"paper"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"multus"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"assist"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"solution"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"transfer"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"task"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"tree"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"optimal"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"generate"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"cost"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"design"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"search"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"gravity"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"continuous"}],"topicIndex":46,"mainTopicIds":["9","17","0"]},{"topicId":"47","topDocs":[{"docId":"321","weight":0.7364,"docData":{"date":"03\/10\/17","money":"897","wordCount":"120","university":"D","abstract":"Chemical investigation of a sample of propolis originating from North-Western Cameroon led to the isolation of thirteen alk(en)ylphenols (1-13) (inseparable mixture) along with α-amyrin (14), β-amyrin (15), lupeol (16), cycloartenol (17), mangiferonic acid (18), ambonic acid (19), mangiferolic acid (20), ambolic acid (21), isomangiferolic acid (22) and nine alk(en)ylresorcinols (23-31) (inseparable mixture).

We present shell growth and structural responses by the economically important marine calcifier Mytilus edulis to ocean acidification scenarios (380, 550, 750, 1000≈ atm pCO 2). After six months of incubation at 750≈ atm pCO 2, reduced carbonic anhydrase protein activity and shell growth occurs in M. edulis. Beyond that, at 1000≈ atm pCO 2, biomineralisation continued but with compensated metabolism of proteins and increased calcite growth. Mussel growth occurs at a cost to the structural integrity of the shell due to structural disorientation of calcite crystals.

Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells.

We looked at how the daily life of the men taking part had changed when they became a dad, how these changes possibly influenced their level of physical activity, and what would motivate them to become more active.\n\nThe Lab provided a safe and creative environment through which the Lab team helped participants (\u201Cexperienced dads\u201D) to feel comfortable to share stories, reflect on their lives and explore their motivations.

Since 2008 we have used geographically stratified random sampling of the membership records of the Scottish Beekeepers\u2019 Association, excluding those who opted out of surveys, to select the invited participants. In 2013 our survey was conducted online, as far as possible, using the LimeSurvey software (http:\/\/www.limesurvey.org\/ ) for the first time. This was repeated in 2014.\nIn 2013, 300 participants were selected from 1094 possible participants, of whom 218 (73%) had email contact details. Postal questionnaires were used for the others, those whose email failed or where there were technical problems: 94 questionnaires were posted and 3 sent electronically for postal return.  Analysis of the 2012-2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56.5% experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31.6% (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19.3% for the postal respondents and a much higher 36.6% for the online respondents. This difference is highly significant (Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0.0001297).  Eleven (50%) of the 22 postal respondents and 50 (58.1%) of the 86 online respondents with valid loss data experienced losses, though this difference was not significant. The profile of the beekeepers differed between the two groups: the postal respondents were typically much more experienced beekeepers than the online respondents. It is therefore important for us to include the postal element for beekeepers not contactable by email, even though the response rate for the online survey was higher (65% online; 36% postal; 55% overall). \nIn the 2014 survey, 350 participants were chosen randomly from 1224 possible participants, 273 (78%) had email contact details, and 95 questionnaires were posted, allowing for 17 failing emails and one person with difficulty accessing the survey. \nPreliminary results, based on 118 valid responses collected so far in LimeSurvey from beekeepers, are that 41 (34.7%) experienced losses over winter 2013-14, and that the loss rate was 13.2% (74 colonies lost from 560 wintered colonies).  The final loss rates including postal responses may be expected to be lower.\nThe 2012-13 winter loss rate of 31.6% was the highest since our surveys began, the next highest being 30.9% over winter 2009-10. It seems likely that the much lower loss rate this last winter can largely be attributed to the different weather conditions.","title":"Colony loss monitoring surveys in Scotland: winter loss rates and the online versus postal approach","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"396","weight":0.4243,"docData":{"date":"27\/07\/15","money":"520","wordCount":"66","university":"B","abstract":"The widespread opposition to unprecedented austerity measures in Greece provides a unique opportunity to study the causes of mass protest.

Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company\u2019s imposition, in disregard of collective bargaining procedures, of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new \u2018mixed fleet\u2019 on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a \u2018strategy of decapitation\u2019 of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA\u2019s and crews\u2019 utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a \u2018distributed discourse\u2019 and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions\u2019 ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA\u2019s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.","title":"Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"618","weight":0.1053,"docData":{"date":"04\/09\/18","money":"838","wordCount":"57","university":"B","abstract":"The Internet has broadened many aspects of our lives in untold positive ways.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"431","weight":0.0548,"docData":{"date":"04\/10\/16","money":"941","wordCount":"73","university":"D","abstract":"This article questions the preconceived notions that participants in virtual worlds are essentially consumers.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.

However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage.

We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications.

Post-implantation loss of retinal interneurons or excessive glial scarring could diminish and\/or eliminate PVA-evoked signal transmission. As such, assessing the morphology of the inner retina in RP animal models with subretinal PVAs is an important step in defining biocompatibility and predicting success of signal transmission. In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively compare inner retinal morphology after the implantation of a PVA in two RP models: the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) or transgenic S334ter-line 3 (S334ter-3) rhodopsin mutant rat. Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices. In the S334ter-3 rat, we implanted devices at 6-12 weeks of age and again, inner retinal morphology was generally preserved with either PVA design 16-26 weeks post-implantation. Specifically, the length of rod bipolar cells and numbers of cholinergic amacrine cells were maintained along with their characteristic inner plexiform lamination patterns. Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site. Our results indicate that subretinally implanted PVAs are well-tolerated in rodent RP models and that the inner retinal circuitry is preserved, consistent with our published results showing implant-evoked signal transmission.","title":"Inner retinal preservation in rat models of retinal degeneration implanted with subretinal photovoltaic arrays","authors":"L & K & C"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":15.0,"label":"loss"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"winter"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"online"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"postal"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"respondent"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"survey"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"beekeeper"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"bassa"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"block"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"protest"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"email"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"strike"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"participant"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"colony"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"internet"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"triangular"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"rate"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"organise"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"greece"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"austerity"}],"topicIndex":48,"mainTopicIds":["1","5","16"]},{"topicId":"49","topDocs":[{"docId":"480","weight":0.5664,"docData":{"date":"06\/05\/19","money":"649","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete can alter the interface between the steel and concrete and thus affects the bond mechanism.

The method accounts for the effects of corrosion on the stiffness, maximum strength, residual strength, and failure mode of the bond between the steel and concrete. In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate. It is found in this paper that the increase in the bond strength due to minor corrosion can increase the load-bearing capacity of the wall and the corrosion-affected reinforced concrete walls exhibit less ductile behavior compared with the uncorroded walls.

Experimentally, a change of the initial vertical comb-offset from 10.4 μm to 4.9 μm leads to a reduction of the measured dynamic total optical scan angle (TOSA) from 27° to 19° for 100 V ac actuation. In addition, a mechanically assisted deflection of the AVC actuators to achieve an almost in-plane comb configuration further reduces the measured dynamic TOSA to about 3°. The overall device behavior is modeled using a hybrid simulation approach combining FEM analysis of the AVC capacitance with an analytical solution of the motion equation of the scanner.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations).

On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.","title":"Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"408","weight":0.7453,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/15","money":"748","wordCount":"107","university":"E","abstract":"Placement of additional control devices along the span of the wind turbine blades is being considered for multi-MW wind turbines to actively alter the local aerodynamic characteristics of the blades.

Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, pitch actuator travel is reduced by 15 pitch rates by 23 and pitch accelerations by 42 This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades.

On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments.

This paper presents a study and the results on the sintering kinetics of the powder during Micro-FAST for the fabrication of micro-gears (the module is 0.2 and the pitch diameter 1.6 mm) from copper powder. The results showed that the densification of copper powder is related largely to the bulk plastic-deformations of the particles and the melting of the particles at contact interfaces. Particularly, it is revealed that plastic deformations of the copper particles mainly occurred at approximately 340 °C and melting of the particle-interfaces at approximately 640 °C.

Energy autarky can be described as  a location that relies on its own energy  resources  for  generating  the  useful  energy  required  to  sustain  the  society  within  that region  or a situation in which a region does not import substantial amounts of energy resources. Functioning  autarkic  energy  systems  typically  require  a  micro-grid,  well  understood  energy demand and supply characteristics, opportunities for energy storage of various types and controls able to  manage the harmonisation of system components. A critical additional ingredient is users who can work within constraints created by the adoption of autarkic principles.  To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in \ndelivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments. In addition, monitored data from a community micro-grid system in  Northern  Scotland  is  analysed  and  presented  to  provide  additional  understanding  of  the complexities and opportunities created by  an autarkic approach. The output from the workshop identified that whilst it is probable that a dogmatic interpretation of energy autarkic will not be universally  applicable,  the  underlying  principles  represent  a  bottom  up  way  of  widening participation in the development of future energy provision models. Whilst a number of issues and  barriers  were  raised  regarding  its  adoption,  the  attendees  recognised  that  energy  autarky represented  a  very  positive  and  empowering  vision  for  translating  global  scale  issues  to  local energy transition.    The analysis of monitored generation and demand data from a community micro-grid  underlined  the  problems  associated  with  supply-demand  matching  with  intermittent generation and the need to  place an emphasis on the  community or entity  as an open system that is able to participate in a full range of trading opportunities.

Atomistic multi-tip diamond tool models were built with different tool geometries in terms of the difference in the tip cross-sectional shape, tip angle, and the feature of tool tip configuration, to determine their effect on the applied forces and the machined nano-groove geometries. The quality of machined nanostructures was characterized by the thickness of the deformed layers and the dimensional accuracy achieved. Simulation results show that diamond turning using nanoscale multi-tip tools offers tremendous shape transferability in machining nanostructures. Both periodic and non-periodic nano-grooves with different cross-sectional shapes can be successfully fabricated using the multi-tip tools. A hypothesis of minimum designed ratio of tool tip distance to tip base width (L\/Wf) of the nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool for the high precision machining of nanostructures was proposed based on the analytical study of the quality of the nanostructures fabricated using different types of the multi-tip tools. Nanometric cutting trials using nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools (different in L\/Wf) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) were then conducted to verify the hypothesis.

This paper employs a facile process for the micropatterning of polymer substrates for the manufacture of capacitive transducers. A positive mask of the desired cavity microstructure is deposited onto a polystyrene substrate. The substrate is then exposed to a saturated toluene vapour which is absorbed by the polystyrene causing swelling of the surface except in the areas where the droplets are situated resulting in the formation of micro-cavities at the position of each droplet.

We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.","title":"Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"554","weight":0.0313,"docData":{"date":"22\/11\/17","money":"107","wordCount":"103","university":"E","abstract":"This work has provided a novel idea of fabricating MnZn bulk ferrite materials.

However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.","title":"Highly anisotropic metasurface: a polarized beam splitter and hologram","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"730","weight":0.0164,"docData":{"date":"21\/04\/15","money":"539","wordCount":"130","university":"B","abstract":"Polystyrene 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine (Ps.AMP) supported molybdenum (Mo)(VI) complex (Ps.AMP.Mo) was prepared, characterized and assessed as a catalyst for batch and continuous epoxidation of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene (4-VCH) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant.

Complementarity to the 5' end of exon 7 increases U2AF65 binding, but the ESE sequence is required for efficient recruitment of U2 snRNP. The ESE forms at least three coexisting discrete states: a quadruplex, a complex containing only hnRNP F\/H, and a complex enriched in the activator SRSF1. Neither hnRNP H nor quadruplex formation contributes to ESE activity.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"315","weight":0.0089,"docData":{"date":"30\/04\/17","money":"250","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"The paper presents a novel algorithm for the automatic planning and scheduling of multi-gravity assist trajectories (MGA). The algorithm translates the design of an MGA transfer into a planning and scheduling process in which each planetary encounter is seen as a scheduled task. All possible transfers form a directional graph that is incrementally built and explored simultaneously forward from the departure planet to the arrival one and backward from the arrival planet to the departure one. Nodes in the graph (or tree) represent tasks (or planetary encounters). Backward and forward generated transfers are then matched during the construction of the tree to improve both convergence and exploration. It can be shown, in fact, that the multi-directional exploration of the tree, allows for better quality solutions for the same computational cost. Unlike branch and prune algorithms that use a set of deterministic branching and pruning heuristics, the algorithm proposed in this paper progressively builds a probabilistic model over all the possible tasks that form a complete trajectory. No branch is pruned but the probability of selecting one particular task increases as the algorithm progresses in the search for a solution.

India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7\u201337.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846\u2013$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children. Increasing all immunization rates to 90% (intervention two) averts an additional 22.1 (95% UR, 18.6\u201325.7) deaths and $45,914 (95% UR, $37,909\u2013$53,920) OOP expenditure. Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.","title":"Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"771","weight":0.6191,"docData":{"date":"17\/11\/18","money":"650","wordCount":"63","university":"C","abstract":"The epidemiology of ano-genitals cancers is under going substantial change.

This study is focused on bridging the research gap through development of a novel risk management framework that merges the two quantitative techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief networks capture the interdependency between various risk factors while Game theory models the risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders in a supply network. The proposed framework segregates risk drivers, events and consequences and captures their interdependency. Development project of Boeing 787 aircraft was a unique venture in terms of its unconventional supply chain and unproven technology. Instead of the realization of anticipated shorter development time and reduced costs, the project turned out to be a fiasco. A new term \u2018game theoretic risks\u2019 has been coined to acknowledge the risks associated with conflicting incentives of various stakeholders in a supply network. \n\nResearch Approach: This study has focused on a review of the literature for establishing the research gap followed by designing of a novel framework (conceptual model) for quantification and management of supply chain risks. Subsequently, the model has been applied on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft.\n\nFindings and Originality: The developed framework is unique in its design merging two quantitative techniques in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management. Application of the novel framework on a case study of Boeing 787 project revealed its merits in terms of capturing the dynamics of interacting risk factors. Bayesian belief network is a useful modelling technique for risk quantification capturing the interdependency between various risks. Game theoretic modelling provides an opportunity to model the risks associated with conflicting incentives of the stakeholders within a supply network. Game theory based modelling captured the behaviour of suppliers in relation to the uncertainty about cost functions and the final response of Boeing to the delays caused by suppliers. The results clearly manifested importance of the game theoretic risks and as there was no policy to align the incentives of suppliers in Boeing 787 project, there was a major delay causing financial penalty to Boeing. Furthermore, lack of management expertise in Supply Chain Risk Management was a major factor for the higher development cost. It has been proved that lack of information in a supply chain affects the desired objectives of a project. To our best knowledge, such a framework has never been developed and applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management.\n\nResearch Impact: The output of this study will help researchers model the supply chain risks in a more realistic way and stimulate further research in this direction.\n\nPractical Impact: The application of our developed model on a case study reveals its practical impact. Had the Boeing considered the holistic view of the supply chain risks, the project delay and financial loss would not have materialized.

We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed 'Game theoretic risks' in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing's perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap.

It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned. The myth of construction supply chain management and by extension best practice in UK construction continues unabated albeit under a shiny new banner, Construction 2025.","title":"The myth of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"778","weight":0.2813,"docData":{"date":"11\/12\/15","money":"768","wordCount":"64","university":"D","abstract":"This paper aims to scope out some of the implications of desistance research for the community management of high risk offenders.

There were many innovations in the field of agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850s and 1860s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the steam plough, with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870s and 1880s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the steam plough in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to have a major impact on rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler\u2019s steam\nplough.What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure.\nThe environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible. This article will interrogate why, despite its essential unfeasibility, the project was pursued, and will argue that the momentum created by the dynamic between the three networks involved propelled it forward despite growing evidence of failure.\nThis article therefore uses an inductive approach by examining a particular example of agricultural design innovation and analysing the pertinent social issues in what would have been termed by contemporaries \u2018entrepreneurial spirit\u2019.","title":"The role of social networks in agricultural innovation: the Sutherland reclamations and the Fowler steam plough, c.1855-c.1885","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"160","weight":0.1,"docData":{"date":"14\/05\/19","money":"118","wordCount":"90","university":"A","abstract":"Semi-submersible heavy lift vessels (HLVs) are currently the main option for the installation of electrical substation platforms on offshore wind farms.

The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding, whose spatial structure is often characterised by a spatially smooth evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units while other pairs exhibit large step changes. This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify step changes is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy.

Methods: In this report, we compare different transfection reagents as delivery vehicles for gold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides, and quantify their relative transfection efficiencies. The inhibitory properties of small interfering RNA (siRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences targeted to human metallothionein hMT-IIa are also quantified in HeLa cells. Techniques used in this study include fluorescence and confocal microscopy, qPCR and Western analysis. Findings: We show that the use of transfection reagents does significantly increase nanoparticle transfection efficiencies. Furthermore, siRNA, ssRNA and ssDNA sequences all have comparable inhibitory properties to ssDNA sequences immobilized onto gold nanoparticles. We also show that functionalized gold nanoparticles can co-localize with autophagosomes and illustrate other factors that can affect data collection and interpretation when performing studies with functionalized nanoparticles. Conclusions: The desired outcome for biological knockdown studies is the efficient reduction of a specific target; which we demonstrate by using ssDNA inhibitory sequences targeted to human metallothionein IIa gene transcripts that result in the knockdown of both the mRNA transcript and the target protein.","title":"Quantification of functionalised gold nanoparticle-targeted knockdown of gene expression in HeLa cells","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"745","weight":0.034,"docData":{"date":"04\/02\/19","money":"114","wordCount":"207","university":"D","abstract":"A collection of multiple reports on MyDiabetesMyWay (MDMW).

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes tetA and tetB in almost all slaughterhouse zones.

Statistical analysis revealed that resistant bacteria, in most cases, were spread by the same route in almost all slaughterhouse zones, except for tetB, blaCTX and blaTEM genes, which occurred in few zones as isolated 'hot spots'. The sum of all analyzed ARG indicated that slaughterhouse surfaces and end products act as reservoirs of ARG, mainly tet genes, which were more prevalent in slaughtering room (SR), cutting room (CR) and commercial meat products (MP).

Strategically controlling key zones in slaughterhouse (SR, CR and WR) by adequate disinfection methods could strategically reduce the risks of ARG transmission and minimize the issues of food safety and environment contamination.","title":"Diversity, distribution and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in goat and lamb slaughterhouse surfaces and meat products","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"616","weight":0.0247,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/18","money":"301","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) offer interesting possibilities for tuning the affinity of these materials towards certain adsorbates, potentially increasing their selectivity and storage capacity.

In this paper, we review recent developments in the application of quantum-mechanical (QM) methods and classical molecular simulations to understand and predict adsorption in MOFs with CUS.

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"182","weight":0.0223,"docData":{"date":"13\/12\/15","money":"272","wordCount":"45","university":"B","abstract":"The complete description of the lifetime of a droplet on a solid substrate evaporating in a 'stick\u2013slide' mode is obtained.

Conventional water quality models are demand driven and consequently do not incorporate the effects of any deficiency in pressure on the water quality throughout the distribution network. This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory. The results here may be indicative of modelling errors that may not have been recognised explicitly hitherto.","title":"Pressure dependent network water quality modelling","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"329","weight":0.0192,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/19","money":"236","wordCount":"157","university":"A","abstract":"The last decade has seen a huge increase in the amount of \u201Comics\u201D data available and in our ability to interpret those data. The aim of this paper is to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"292","weight":0.0186,"docData":{"date":"12\/08\/15","money":"612","wordCount":"54","university":"E","abstract":"To obtain accurate results in the RHX dating of ceramics, it is essential that the RHX measurements are continued until the rate of mass gain is constant with (time)1\/4.

Description: We developed a Y-shaped chest tube with split ends that divide within the thoracic cavity, permitting separate intrathoracic placement and requiring a single exit port. In this study, thoracic drainage by the split drain vs. that of separate drains was tested.  Methods: After sternotomy, pericardiotomy, and left pleurotomy, pigs were fitted with separate chest drains (n=10) or a split tube prototype (n=9) with internal openings positioned in the mediastinum and in the costodiaphragmatic recess. Separate series of experiments were conducted to test drainage of D5W or 0.58 M sucrose, an aqueous solution with viscosity approximating that of plasma. One litre of fluid was infused into the thorax, and suction was applied at -20 cm H2O for 30 min.  Results: When D5W was infused, the split drain left a residual volume of 53±99 ml (mean value ± SD) vs. 148 ± 120 for the separate drain (P = 0.007), representing a drainage efficiency (i.e. drained vol\/[drained + residual vol]) of 95 ± 10% vs. 86 ± 12% for the separate drains (P = 0.011). In the second series, the split drain evacuated more 0.58 M sucrose in the first minute (967 ± 129 ml) than the separate drains (680 ± 192 ml, P<0.001). By 30 min, the split drain evacuated a similar volume of sucrose vs. the conventional drain (1089 ± 72 vs. 1056 ± 78 ml; P = 0.5).

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the motor points of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.  Low frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. The electrode positions which achieved the strongest muscle contractions were recorded as the motor point positions, with measurements repeated once. For five able bodied participants, assessments were repeated after 18 months, in seated and supine positions.  Intersubject uniformity ranged from 2.8 to 8.8 %. Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of <1.7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (<1.7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3.1 cm.  A simple technique to locate the motor points of the abdominal muscles is presented and shown to have an adequate intrasubject repeatability, enabling the optimum AFES electrode location to be identified for each user.","title":"Detection of the motor points of the abdominal muscles","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"227","weight":0.5593,"docData":{"date":"20\/03\/18","money":"843","wordCount":"212","university":"A","abstract":"To promote early rehabilitation of walking, gait training can start even when patients are on bed rest. Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"628","weight":0.3565,"docData":{"date":"01\/09\/15","money":"416","wordCount":"107","university":"E","abstract":"Performing gait analysis in a clinical setting can often be challenging due to time, cost and the availability of sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis systems.

The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"455","weight":0.1172,"docData":{"date":"15\/01\/15","money":"657","wordCount":"116","university":"A","abstract":"Previous studies have employed generic 3D-multiscale models to predict haemodynamic effects of the hybrid procedure in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were counsellors in training.

Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98).

The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.

The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population).

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention. This has implications for the diagnosis\/management of common symptoms in cancer patients.","title":"Does cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia reduce clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in cancer patients?","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"234","weight":0.0385,"docData":{"date":"07\/07\/15","money":"357","wordCount":"80","university":"B","abstract":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, widely present in the environment, is well known for its ability to cause infection in immune compromised individuals.

During the past 15 years, particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified, initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and\/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.","title":"Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"389","weight":0.0218,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/18","money":"432","wordCount":"47","university":"A","abstract":"Offences which are required to be jointly reported to the Procurator Fiscal (PF) and the Children\u2019s Reporter can be found here.

However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective \u2013 and potentially antagonistic - social identities.","title":"Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"145","weight":0.0167,"docData":{"date":"25\/12\/19","money":"442","wordCount":"124","university":"D","abstract":"The cross-infection effect of 105 polymer samples was studied, using cellulose as a reference test material.

In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter. The favourable gap between Scotland and UK manufacturing performance during the recovery therefore continues to be large.

The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"72","weight":0.1649,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/15","money":"203","wordCount":"92","university":"E","abstract":"Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013) was the United Kingdom's prime minister from 1979 to 1990.

This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper.

In Scotland, the implementation phase of the new 1+2 languages policy might provide the impetus to develop a comparable initiative to \u2018Routes\u2019.  Arguably, a sea change in attitudes to language learning is unlikely to happen without durable and sustainable social capital between staff in school and university.","title":"Social capital and modern language initiatives in times of policy uncertainty","authors":"A"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":54.0,"label":"growth"},{"weight":50.0,"label":"scottish"},{"weight":48.0,"label":"scotland"},{"weight":41.0,"label":"economic"},{"weight":25.0,"label":"economy"},{"weight":23.0,"label":"gdp"},{"weight":22.0,"label":"recovery"},{"weight":21.0,"label":"recession"},{"weight":20.0,"label":"quarter"},{"weight":18.0,"label":"employment"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"pre"},{"weight":15.0,"label":"data"},{"weight":14.0,"label":"year"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"continue"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"evidence"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"peak"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"activity"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"variable"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"previous"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"key"}],"topicIndex":56,"mainTopicIds":["18","4","16"]},{"topicId":"57","topDocs":[{"docId":"417","weight":0.7273,"docData":{"date":"02\/09\/19","money":"657","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"This paper describes spatial and temporal distributions of bone loss in the paralysed limbs of patients  during their first year after spinal cord injury (SCI).

Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.\nMaterial and Methods\nTwo embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.\nResults\nStatistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p\u200A=\u200A<0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC\u200A=\u200A0.851). Sensitivity and specificity for tissue identification was 77% and 70% respectively to a resolution of 6 mm2.\nConclusions\nThis cadaveric study has evaluated the ability of our elasticity assessment device to differentiate bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter to a resolution of 6 mm2. The results provide useful data for which to continue to examine the use of elasticity assessment devices for tissue quality assessment with the aim of giving haptic feedback to surgeons performing complex surgery.","title":"Tissue quality assessment using a novel direct elasticity assessment device (the e-finger): a cadaveric study of prostatectomy dissection","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"30","weight":0.544,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/18","money":"270","wordCount":"126","university":"C","abstract":"Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is believed to be accompanied by increased activation of the sensory and motor cortices.

This study reports on the presence of transient EEG based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyse dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronisation in the theta, alpha and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both non-painful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronisation during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.","title":"Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"495","weight":0.4286,"docData":{"date":"30\/10\/16","money":"423","wordCount":"178","university":"A","abstract":"The disuse-related bone loss that results from immobilisation following injury shares characteristics with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and the aged, with decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) leading to weakening of the bone and increased risk of fracture.

The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.

A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population).

The mechanical behaviour of the surrounding tissues is determined by adopting a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model, while the mechanical description of fibres is considered to be the sum of active and passive stresses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, evaluation of the Jacobian matrix is carried out in order to subsequently utilise the standard Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and to carry out time integration with an implicit scheme. The proposed methodology is implemented into our in-house, open source, finite element software, which is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental measurements and other numerical results.

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes. Further concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders are required to fully integrate preoperative assessment within the health-board surgical care pathway.

Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"732","weight":0.0572,"docData":{"date":"01\/03\/16","money":"901","wordCount":"73","university":"D","abstract":"Consumer perception of beef quality has been shown to be largely dependent upon three factors, which are tenderness, juiciness and flavour.

Harmonics are generated by either linearly or circularly polarized pulses from the J-KAREN (KPSI, JAEA) and Astra Gemini (CLF, RAL, UK) lasers. The photon number scalability has been demonstrated with a 120 TW laser producing 40 μJ\/sr per harmonic at 120 eV. The experimental results are explained using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and catastrophe theory. A new mechanism of harmonic generation by sharp, structurally stable, oscillating electron spikes at the joint of boundaries of wake and bow waves excited by a laser pulse is introduced. In this paper detailed descriptions of the experiments, simulations and model are provided and new features are shown, including data obtained with a two-channel spectrograph, harmonic generation by circularly polarized laser pulses and angular distribution.","title":"High order harmonics from relativistic electron spikes","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"698","weight":0.1959,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/16","money":"632","wordCount":"98","university":"B","abstract":"This document describes the development of a full scale empirical validation dataset for building energy simulation tools.

The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon\u2019s surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system. Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing\/take-off pathways to and from Phobos\u2019 surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.","title":"Dynamical systems techniques for designing libration point orbits in proximity of highly-inhomogeneous planetary satellites: Application to the Mars-Phobos elliptic three-body problem with additional gravity harmonics","authors":"H"}},{"docId":"269","weight":0.079,"docData":{"date":"21\/04\/19","money":"394","wordCount":"80","university":"C","abstract":"Two novel triads based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) central core and two 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) units attached by thiophene rings have been synthesised having high molar extinction coefficients.

The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies.","title":"Modelling the impact of temperature-induced life history plasticity and mate limitation on the epidemic potential of a marine ectoparasite","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"171","weight":0.0572,"docData":{"date":"06\/08\/18","money":"693","wordCount":"107","university":"C","abstract":"Despite an increasing recognition of the relevance and significance of self-compassion processes, little research has explored interventions that seek to enhance these in therapy.

Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.

The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally.

This paper derives the fault-tolerant control logic under both actuator gain fault mode and actuator deviation fault mode. Taking the parameters of the UKube-1 in the simulation model, a comparison between a traditional spacecraft control method and the adaptive fault-tolerant control method in the presence of a fault is undertaken. It is shown that the proposed controller copes with faults and is able to complete an effective attitude control manoeuver in the presence of a fault.","title":"An application of adaptive fault-tolerant control to nano-spacecraft","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"644","weight":0.3379,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/16","money":"859","wordCount":"226","university":"E","abstract":"The successful miniaturization of spacecraft subsystems makes nanosatellites suitable candidates for many scientific missions, and several miniaturized electric propulsion systems on CubeSats have been studied. A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"512","weight":0.2308,"docData":{"date":"02\/08\/19","money":"463","wordCount":"65","university":"E","abstract":"The dynamics of solar sails with a variable surface reflectivity distribution are investigated.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"630","weight":0.0721,"docData":{"date":"10\/10\/19","money":"194","wordCount":"112","university":"C","abstract":"A comparison has been made of the converter lifetime for a 3MW fully rated converter horizontal axis wind turbine located onshore and offshore.

These applications, and many others, are all defined in the Sun-Earth three-body problem, while little research has been conducted to investigate the potential of solar sailing in the Earth-Moon three-body problem. This paper therefore aims to find solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem, in particular Lagrange-point orbits. By introducing a solar sail acceleration to the Earth-Moon three-body problem, the system becomes non-autonomous and constraints on the orbital period need to be imposed. In this paper, the problem is solved as a two-point boundary value problem together with a continuation approach: starting from a natural Lagrange-point orbit, the solar sail acceleration is gradually increased and the result for the previous sail performance is used as an initial guess for a slightly better sail performance. Three in-plane steering laws are considered for the sail, two where the attitude of the sail is fixed in the synodic reference frame (perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line) and one where the sail always faces the Sun. The results of the paper include novel families of solar sail Lyapunov and Halo orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lagrange points, respectively. These orbits are double-revolution orbits that wind around or are off-set with respect to the natural Lagrange-point orbit. Finally, the effect of an out-of-plane solar sail acceleration component and that of the Sun-sail configuration is investigated, giving rise to additional families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem.","title":"Solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"645","weight":0.0235,"docData":{"date":"14\/06\/19","money":"556","wordCount":"128","university":"B","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to explore the reaction of customer facing staff and their attitude to the introduction of high profile corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes; in particular their level of awareness and willingness to implement them.\nConducted using a series of site visits and interviews with managers working within the licensed trade, this was followed up with structured interviews of \"front line\" staff.\nDespite high levels of awareness of both the social problems relating to alcohol consumption and the legislative changes, engagement with operational CSR was limited and often disinterested.

The motivating hypothesis was that such stochastic resonance can be efficiently realized in a bistable mechanism. However, the condition for the occurrence of stochastic resonance is conventionally defined by the Kramers rate. This definition is inadequate because of the necessity and difficulty in estimating white noise density. A bistable mechanism has been designed using an explicit analytical model which implies a new approach for achieving stochastic resonance in the paper. Experimental tests confirm that the addition of a small-scale force to the bistable system excited by a random signal apparently leads to a corresponding amplification of the response that we now term square-wave-driven stochastic resonance.

The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations.

The detection limit of benzene, toluene and o-xylene was 0.5, 0.8 and 0.5 mg kg-1, respectively. Average differences between the actual and predicted concentrations, expressed as a percentage of the actual concentrations, for 27-82 mg kg-1of benzene, toluene and o-xylene were 0.5-1.4%, 0.0-0.4% and 0.3-1.6%, respectively, while the average relative standard deviations were 1.3-2.6%, 1.0-2.5% and 1.1-2.3%, respectively. Detection of 3 mg kg-1changes in the concentration of each of the analytes (at the 36 mg kg-1level) was also demonstrated, indicating the sensitivity of the technique and the potential ability of the procedure to detect minor deviations in the specification of process streams from continuous analysis.","title":"On-line detection and quantification of trace impurities in vaporisable samples by direct liquid introduction process mass spectrometry","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"363","weight":0.1605,"docData":{"date":"19\/09\/19","money":"880","wordCount":"81","university":"C","abstract":"We study the thermalization of excitations generated by spontaneous emission events for cold bosons in an optical lattice.

The relationship between the metastable limit and cooling rate is of particular interest, as it can be utilized to derive nucleation kinetic parameters. However, this relationship is open to interpretation. This work presents the application of three such interpretations (Nývlt, Kubota and a population balance based method) to a cooling crystallization of adipic acid in an oscillatory baffled crystallizer, a relatively new type of crystallizer with increased studies and applications in continuous plug flow operation. It also considers the role the device employed to detect nucleation events plays in the derived kinetic parameters. The result of this study shows that although all three interpretations can reasonably predict the maximum sub-cooling over a tested range of cooling rates, the linear assumptions in the Nývlt and Kubota interpretations give increased deviations from the experimental data, in particular for faster cooling rates. In contrast to the two aforementioned models, the population balance based method maintains a minimal deviation across the whole range of cooling rates used. In addition, although the population balance method does not consider the sensitivity of detection tools in its implementation, while the Kubota method does, the sensitivity of nucleation detection is reflected in the derived nucleation rate constants.

There were three aims; to determine if putting actions are scaled by manipulating swing amplitude as predicted by Craig et al.

Putting actions were recorded at baseline (time 1) and 6 months later (time 2) and after walking at 70% of maximum heart rate for 1 h (time 3). Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al. (2000) model had good test-retest reliability. Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact. These motor control changes in performance when fatigued were evident in successful putts indicating that even when these elite golfers were able to achieve the goal of holing the putt, moderate levels of fatigue were influencing the consistency of their performance.

To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC\/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.","title":"High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"534","weight":0.1112,"docData":{"date":"16\/07\/17","money":"198","wordCount":"111","university":"E","abstract":"This short paper introduces an enhancement to the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) by extending it with three new operators to describe interactions on mobile touchscreen devices.

Mass spectrometry measurements were made at selected ion masses, and classical least squares multivariate linear regression was used to produce concentration profiles for the reactants, products and catalyst. The extent of reaction was obtained from the butyl acetate profile and found to be 83% and 76% at 40°C and 20°C, respectively, at the 1L scale. Reactions in the 1L reactor were also monitored by in-line mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry; off-line gas chromatography (GC) was used as a reference technique when building partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration models for prediction of butyl acetate concentrations from the MIR spectra. In validation experiments, good agreement was achieved between the concentration of butyl acetate obtained from in-line MIR spectra and off-line GC. In the initial few minutes of the reaction the profiles for butyl acetate derived from on-line direct liquid sampling mass spectrometry (DLSMS) differed from those of in-line MIR spectrometry owing to the 2min transfer time between the reactor and mass spectrometer. As the reaction proceeded, however, the difference between the concentration profiles became less noticeable. DLSMS had advantages over in-line MIR spectrometry as it was easier to generate concentration profiles for all the components in the reaction. Also, it was possible to detect the presence of a simulated impurity of ethanol (at levels of 2.6 and 9.1% mol\/mol) in butan-1-ol, and the resulting production of ethyl acetate, by DLSMS, but not by in-line MIR spectrometry.","title":"Monitoring of an esterification reaction by on-line direct liquid sampling mass spectrometry and in-line mid infrared spectrometry with an attenuated total reflectance probe","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"586","weight":0.1042,"docData":{"date":"20\/05\/16","money":"640","wordCount":"48","university":"B","abstract":"An accurate knowledge of atomic collision processes is important for a better understanding of many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0.07 m that was partly filled with foamed polyurethane. The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations).

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.","title":"Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"210","weight":0.1548,"docData":{"date":"07\/06\/15","money":"413","wordCount":"84","university":"C","abstract":"Our undergraduate civil engineering students have access to a rich and diverse bank of textual and graphical knowledge concerning their chosen profession.

Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"751","weight":0.125,"docData":{"date":"05\/11\/16","money":"312","wordCount":"48","university":"C","abstract":"The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill completed Stage 2 of the legislative process on 21 January 2014.

Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"535","weight":0.0847,"docData":{"date":"05\/03\/16","money":"937","wordCount":"132","university":"A","abstract":"Capacitive ultrasonic transducers (cUT) comprise a substrate patterned with a regular array of uniformly dimensioned cavities above which a membrane is positioned.

Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode DC component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a DC to DC transformer where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an AC transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed DC transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability.

How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.\nThe study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011\u201312, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"610","weight":0.0521,"docData":{"date":"20\/04\/17","money":"638","wordCount":"96","university":"C","abstract":"As curricular development in Scotland espoused the importance of pupil participation, the extent to which this has been embedded across teachers\u2019 pedagogy into assessment and reporting practices warranted investigation.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. \nTo address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. \nThe SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper. Compared with the existing process, the new process is significantly streamlined, and permits an IED-independent system configuration tool to carry out the entire configuration process. No proprietary software or communications are needed. It also allows the protection settings to be performed at a system level, rather than individually on a \u201Cper device\u201D basis. \nThe key challenges that must be addressed in order for the proposed process to be widely adopted are: the IEC 61850 data model for protection settings is not complete; vendors may prefer to maintain proprietary formats; the data model should have the capability to be extended for future protection functions. This paper reports the progress towards addressing these challenges.","title":"Improving IEC 61850 interoperability and simplifying IED configuration through the standardisation of protection settings","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"0","weight":0.0099,"docData":{"date":"13\/01\/19","money":"536","wordCount":"107","university":"A","abstract":"This article considers the future development of the constitutionalisation of labour rights, in particular non-discrimination rights and collective labour rights, within the European Union\u2019s (EU) legal order following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and in light of the EU\u2019s impending accession to the Council of Europe.

To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described.

During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.","title":"High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"550","weight":0.008,"docData":{"date":"25\/04\/18","money":"438","wordCount":"128","university":"B","abstract":"This article is a case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in the lives of young lesbians in the United Kingdom.

The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.

The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population).

Finally, that overall workload in autonomous vehicle scenarios was lower compared to manual vehicle scenarios.","title":"What's around the corner?

Patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to conventional therapy were recruited and given L-NNA intravenously at two different dose levels. Volumetric perfusion CT scans were carried out at 1, 24, 48 & 72 hours post L-NNA. Blood pressures were taken at regular interval for 6 hours after LNNA. L-NNA was well tolerated by the four patients who received it. Blood flow (BF) and blood vo-lume (BV) in both tumour and kidney were reduced post L-NNA administration (renal BF\u201420%; renal BV\u2014 19.7%; tumour BF\u201416.9%; tumour BV\u201418.6%), though the effect was more sustained in tumour vasculature. A negative correlation was found between the change in systemic blood pressure and vascular supply to the tu-mour within 1 hour following L-NNA (p < 0.0001). Differences in response to L-NNA by separate target lesions in the same patient were observed. The differential effect of L-NNA on tumour and renal blood flow, and the absence of any significant toxicity in this small cohort of patients permit further dose escalation of L-NNA in future early phase trials. The predictive value of blood pressure change in relation to the acute effect of L-NNA on tumour vasculature deserves further evaluation.","title":"The acute physiological effects of the vaso-active drug, L-NNA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, on renal and tumour perfusion in human subjects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"653","weight":0.0398,"docData":{"date":"15\/07\/18","money":"820","wordCount":"168","university":"A","abstract":"Basic phospholipase A2 was identified from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake.

Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"292","weight":0.0186,"docData":{"date":"12\/08\/15","money":"612","wordCount":"54","university":"E","abstract":"To obtain accurate results in the RHX dating of ceramics, it is essential that the RHX measurements are continued until the rate of mass gain is constant with (time)1\/4.

On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments.

Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures.

By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles.

Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices.

Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site.

To investigate the function of other ATG proteins, RNAi compatible T. brucei were modified to function as autophagy reporter lines by expressing only either YFP-ATG8.1 or YFP-ATG8.2. In the insect procyclic lifecycle stage, independent RNAi down-regulation of ATG3 or ATG7 generated autophagy-defective mutants and confirmed a pro-survival role for autophagy in the procyclic form nutrient starvation response. Similarly, RNAi depletion of ATG5 or ATG7 in the bloodstream form disrupted autophagy, but did not impede proliferation. Further characterisation showed bloodstream form autophagy mutants retain the capacity to undergo the complex cellular remodelling that occurs during differentiation to the procyclic form and are equally susceptible to dihydroxyacetone-induced cell death as wild type parasites, not supporting a role for autophagy in this cell death mechanism. The RNAi reporter system developed, which also identified TOR1 as a negative regulator controlling YFP-ATG8.2 but not YFP-ATG8.1 autophagosome formation, will enable further targeted analysis of the mechanisms and function of autophagy in the medically relevant bloodstream form of T. brucei.","title":"Tracking autophagy during proliferation and differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"159","weight":0.275,"docData":{"date":"20\/07\/17","money":"416","wordCount":"80","university":"C","abstract":"We use objective boundary conditions and self-consistent charge density-functional-based tight-binding to simulate at the atomistic scale the formation of helices in narrow graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges terminated with fluorine and hydrogen.

Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI).

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"703","weight":0.0539,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/19","money":"577","wordCount":"131","university":"D","abstract":"With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and  renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins.

An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by blaNDM-1 genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and blaNDM-1 genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about blaNDM-1 levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May\/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG) and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1 levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 ± 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 ± 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg-1)) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were very low across all sites (2.1 ± 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1)) in February in the Upper Ganges and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1 levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February and blaNDM-1 levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r=0.61; p=0.007). Given waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar; data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible \"hot spots\" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.","title":"Increased waterborne blaNDM-1 resistance gene abundances associated with seasonal human pilgrimages to the Upper Ganges River","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"386","weight":0.4238,"docData":{"date":"20\/01\/15","money":"439","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"For the first time, ammonia has been directly synthesised from wet air at intermediate temperature.

The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory.

Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further harmonisation is needed, but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively. It is within this context that the UNCSD can be seen as an international agenda setting process and three key water related topics appear to be on such agenda: water and sanitation; water and ecosystem services and water and climate change.

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","title":"Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"640","weight":0.0519,"docData":{"date":"18\/03\/19","money":"784","wordCount":"139","university":"A","abstract":"This study aimed to monitor the microbiological effect of cleaning near-patient sites over a 48-hour period with a novel disinfectant, electrolyzed water.

Putting actions were recorded at baseline (time 1) and 6 months later (time 2) and after walking at 70% of maximum heart rate for 1 h (time 3). Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al.

Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact.

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention.

The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"623","weight":0.181,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/15","money":"309","wordCount":"105","university":"D","abstract":"This paper examines the origins of the infant mind in its first purposeful movements, evident in utero, and traces their development into complex projects of social meaning-making in the first year of life.

At first, these are basic and simple, but over development they become serially organised into projects requiring greater knowledge of their distal consequences, as they expand in capacity and reach.

In social engagement, self-generated acts of expression made with another co-create regular, non-verbal narrative patterns that establish common meaning available for social understanding and sharing intentions.  By tracing development of meaning-making from solo projects in utero to shared narrative projects in early life, we can better appreciate social patterns and their compositions evident in health, disrupted in pathology, and important for development and learning.","title":"On the origins of understanding: from early intentions in utero to shared social projects of common purpose","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"513","weight":0.0295,"docData":{"date":"25\/11\/19","money":"347","wordCount":"71","university":"A","abstract":"Propolis is increasingly being explored as a source of biologically active compounds.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":14.0,"label":"fatigue"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"symptom"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"depression"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"walk"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"clinical"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"putt"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"golfer"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"common"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"change"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"cbt"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"insomnia"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"cardiometabolic"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"put"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"regular"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"baseline"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"level"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"relationship"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"craig"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"anxiety"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"graph"}],"topicIndex":68,"mainTopicIds":["8","19","0"]},{"topicId":"69","topDocs":[{"docId":"729","weight":0.523,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/18","money":"359","wordCount":"109","university":"A","abstract":"Despite increasing policy emphasis on developing and retaining an aging workforce, this paper demonstrates employer use of electronic performance monitoring (EPM) as part of performance management which can adversely affect older workers.

Evidence is presented from union informants representing employees in two technologically-intensive service sectors: the financial sector and telecommunications. These sectors were amongst the first to utilize technology in a way which had transformative implications for work processes and people management in white-collar service work. In both sectors and across clerical and engineering work contexts, the data show the use of EPM by managers to guide punitive performance management for sickness absence and perceived reduced capability. Older workers emerge as a vulnerable group, with manager decisions shown to be based on age stereotypes.

This paper highlights some of the findings from the first empirical examination of the growth performance of employee-owned businesses (EOBs) ever undertaken in Scotland. The study involved an in-depth examination of a small sample of employee owned firms and a quasi-experimental comparison of these firms against a control group of non-employee owned firms. The study confirms that the performance of EBOs is generally superior to that of non EBOs on a number of different variables. On average, employee-owned firms both employ more staff and exhibit higher turnover growth than their peers.

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx\u2019s work on fictitious capital.  Fictitious capital is any form of investment (for example bonds, stocks, derivatives, and collateralized debt obligations) which is based upon the expectation of future returns.  According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value \u2013 only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession\u2019s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.  The intuitional structures of accounting mean that it is susceptible of being captured by the most powerful in society.","title":"Accounting for the fictitious: a Marxist contribution to understanding accounting's roles in the financial crisis","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.2877,"docData":{"date":"11\/09\/19","money":"421","wordCount":"73","university":"B","abstract":"The expansion of creative and cultural industries has provided a rich source for theoretical claims and commentary.

Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the last 6 quarters. In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter. The favourable gap between Scotland and UK manufacturing performance during the recovery therefore continues to be large. In Scottish construction whi le growth in the sector has picked up since the heavy recession period of 2010q4 to 2012q1 performance appears to have weakened relative to the UK from the start of last year. The sector is still very much depressed in both the UK and Scotland.

Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives.

Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned. The myth of construction supply chain management and by extension best practice in UK construction continues unabated albeit under a shiny new banner, Construction 2025.","title":"The myth of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"767","weight":0.0407,"docData":{"date":"25\/10\/15","money":"302","wordCount":"175","university":"C","abstract":"The Active Healthy Kids Canada (AHKC) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth has been effective in powering the movement to get kids moving by influencing priorities, policies, and practice in Canada. The AHKC Report Card process was replicated in 14 additional countries from 5 continents using 9 common indicators (Overall Physical Activity, Organized Sport Participation, Active Play, Active Transportation, Sedentary Behavior, Family and Peers, School, Community and Built Environment, and Government Strategies and Investments), a harmonized process and a standardized grading framework. The 15 Report Cards were presented at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children in Toronto on May 20, 2014. The consolidated findings are summarized here in the form of a global matrix of grades. There is a large spread in grades across countries for most indicators. Countries that lead in certain indicators lag in others. Overall, the grades for indicators of physical activity (PA) around the world are low\/poor. Many countries have insufficient information to assign a grade, particularly for the Active Play and Family and Peers indicators. Grades for Sedentary Behaviors are, in general, better in low income countries. The Community and Built Environment indicator received high grades in high income countries and notably lower grades in low income countries. There was a pattern of higher PA and lower sedentary behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower PA and higher sedentary behavior in countries reporting better infrastructure, which presents an interesting paradox. Many surveillance and research\ngaps and weaknesses were apparent. International cooperation and cross-fertilization is encouraged to tackle existing challenges, understand underlying mechanisms, derive innovative solutions, and overcome the expanding childhood inactivity crisis.","title":"Physical activity of children: a global matrix of grades comparing 15 countries","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"576","weight":0.0378,"docData":{"date":"27\/01\/17","money":"488","wordCount":"106","university":"B","abstract":"Several studies have been conducted by environmental psychologists on worker satisfaction from office spaces with the attempt to relate it to human productivity and profit.

The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

The aim of this paper is to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"141","weight":0.0289,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/16","money":"124","wordCount":"104","university":"D","abstract":"Stochastic resonance is a physical phenomenon through which the throughput of energy within an oscillator excited by a stochastic source can be boosted by adding a small modulating excitation.

However, the condition for the occurrence of stochastic resonance is conventionally defined by the Kramers rate. This definition is inadequate because of the necessity and difficulty in estimating white noise density. A bistable mechanism has been designed using an explicit analytical model which implies a new approach for achieving stochastic resonance in the paper. Experimental tests confirm that the addition of a small-scale force to the bistable system excited by a random signal apparently leads to a corresponding amplification of the response that we now term square-wave-driven stochastic resonance.

Reflecting its anti-inflammatory actions, we have previously reported that ES-62 protects mice from developing Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA): thus, as this helminth-derived product may exhibit therapeutic potential in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is important to understand the protective immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by ES-62 in this model in vivo. We have established to date that ES-62 acts by downregulating pathogenic Th17\/IL-17-mediated responses and upregulating the regulatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, our studies have identified that IL-22, another member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, exerts dual pathogenic and protective roles in this model of RA with ES-62 harnessing the cytokine's inflammation-resolving and tissue repair properties in the joint during the established phase of disease. Here, we discuss the counter-regulatory roles of IL-22 in the murine model of CIA and present additional novel data showing that ES-62 selectively induces γδ T cells with the capacity to induce IL-22 production and that γδ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-22, but not IL-17, induced during CIA can be identified by their expression of TLR4. Moreover, we also show that treatment of mice undergoing CIA with the active PC moiety of ES-62, in the form of PC conjugated to BSA, is not only sufficient to mimic the ES-62-dependent suppression of pathogenic IL-17 responses shown previously but also that of the IL-22 and IL-10 up-regulation observed with the parasitic worm product during CIA. These findings not only reinforce the potential of IL-22, firstly described as a Th17-related pro-inflammatory cytokine, as a protective factor in arthritis but also suggest that drugs based on the PC moiety found in ES-62 may be able to harness the joint-protecting activities of IL-22 therapeutically.","title":"The parasitic worm product ES-62 up-regulates IL-22 production by γδ T cells in the murine model of collagen-induced arthritis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"37","weight":0.0115,"docData":{"date":"12\/06\/17","money":"554","wordCount":"87","university":"B","abstract":"I present a datatype-generic treatment of recursive container types whose elements are guaranteed to be stored in increasing order, with the ordering invariant rolled out systematically.

As recently as August 2013, Ofcom reported that fixed broadband uptake in Glasgow remained at 50%; this is significantly below the Scottish average of 68% (Ofcom, 2013). As the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 agenda of the United Kingdom government, which places government services online, becomes ever more pervasive this becomes a more pressing issue for the city. That needs to find ways to increase broadband adoption. There is also a need to uncover the deep seated reasons why there has been no improvement in fixed broadband uptake in the last five years in Glasgow. Internet access is lowest amongst the most deprived in society and those with the lowest incomes (SHS, 2012). Analysis based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation highlights that \u2018income deprivation in Glasgow City is greater than in Scotland as a whole\u2019- 21.5% of Glasgow\u2019s population were income deprived in 2012 (Scottish Government, 2012a, p3).\nThis paper focuses on the deprived areas of Glasgow and whether and how the most disadvantaged in the city use the Internet. The analysis draws on data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and from individuals in deprived areas. This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:\n In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?\n Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?\n What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?\nThe attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.\nSince geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to\n2\nhow they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.\nThere are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.\nThis paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.\nThe second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.\nThis paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities. There are multiple organisations which could assist in addressing the diverse needs of communities in increasing Internet access. However, they will need to work together and be responsive to the diverse needs of these communities. The evidence also provides direction for Glasgow City Council on ways to engage the disconnected, move forward with their Digital Strategy and close the Digital chasm that exists in the city.","title":"Internet access among the most income deprived: the case of Glasgow","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"423","weight":0.5933,"docData":{"date":"23\/06\/19","money":"286","wordCount":"59","university":"D","abstract":"STV is often extolled because it allows voters to express a nuanced choice, but is criticised for being too confusing.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"308","weight":0.1411,"docData":{"date":"10\/03\/16","money":"414","wordCount":"79","university":"E","abstract":"Many socioeconomic studies have been carried out to explain the phenomenon of gentrification.

How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.\nThe study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011\u201312, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"210","weight":0.0953,"docData":{"date":"07\/06\/15","money":"413","wordCount":"84","university":"C","abstract":"Our undergraduate civil engineering students have access to a rich and diverse bank of textual and graphical knowledge concerning their chosen profession.

CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"747","weight":0.0505,"docData":{"date":"13\/01\/19","money":"946","wordCount":"119","university":"C","abstract":"New media are commonplace in children\u2019s lives.

Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their \u2018feet on the ground\u2019 where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for \u2018generation bagging\u2019  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.  We contribute to heritage tourism studies by revealing how extensive and well preserved archives, local knowledge and a passion for family history can serve to generate unique and deeply emotional tourism experiences for ancestral tourists.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language.

These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"252","weight":0.0197,"docData":{"date":"24\/04\/19","money":"468","wordCount":"51","university":"E","abstract":"CELCIS has been working with a number of local authorities throughout Scotland using 'Improvement Methodology' to improve educational outcomes for looked after children.

Since 2008 we have used geographically stratified random sampling of the membership records of the Scottish Beekeepers\u2019 Association, excluding those who opted out of surveys, to select the invited participants. In 2013 our survey was conducted online, as far as possible, using the LimeSurvey software (http:\/\/www.limesurvey.org\/ ) for the first time. This was repeated in 2014.\nIn 2013, 300 participants were selected from 1094 possible participants, of whom 218 (73%) had email contact details. Postal questionnaires were used for the others, those whose email failed or where there were technical problems: 94 questionnaires were posted and 3 sent electronically for postal return.  Analysis of the 2012-2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56.5% experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31.6% (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19.3% for the postal respondents and a much higher 36.6% for the online respondents. This difference is highly significant (Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0.0001297).  Eleven (50%) of the 22 postal respondents and 50 (58.1%) of the 86 online respondents with valid loss data experienced losses, though this difference was not significant. The profile of the beekeepers differed between the two groups: the postal respondents were typically much more experienced beekeepers than the online respondents. It is therefore important for us to include the postal element for beekeepers not contactable by email, even though the response rate for the online survey was higher (65% online; 36% postal; 55% overall). \nIn the 2014 survey, 350 participants were chosen randomly from 1224 possible participants, 273 (78%) had email contact details, and 95 questionnaires were posted, allowing for 17 failing emails and one person with difficulty accessing the survey. \nPreliminary results, based on 118 valid responses collected so far in LimeSurvey from beekeepers, are that 41 (34.7%) experienced losses over winter 2013-14, and that the loss rate was 13.2% (74 colonies lost from 560 wintered colonies).  The final loss rates including postal responses may be expected to be lower.\nThe 2012-13 winter loss rate of 31.6% was the highest since our surveys began, the next highest being 30.9% over winter 2009-10. It seems likely that the much lower loss rate this last winter can largely be attributed to the different weather conditions.","title":"Colony loss monitoring surveys in Scotland: winter loss rates and the online versus postal approach","authors":"G & H"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":24.0,"label":"internet"},{"weight":22.0,"label":"local"},{"weight":20.0,"label":"area"},{"weight":19.0,"label":"provide"},{"weight":17.0,"label":"city"},{"weight":16.0,"label":"glasgow"},{"weight":14.0,"label":"data"},{"weight":13.0,"label":"trust"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"access"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"income"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"deprivation"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"community"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"highlight"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"government"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"scottish"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"analysis"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"cab"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"deprive"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"national"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"country"}],"topicIndex":71,"mainTopicIds":["16","5","0"]},{"topicId":"72","topDocs":[{"docId":"727","weight":0.6302,"docData":{"date":"28\/09\/19","money":"103","wordCount":"148","university":"C","abstract":"Purpose: This article explores the nature and role of career boundaries for enabling\/constraining career self-management for occupational boundary-crossing in the UK graduate labour market.\nMethodology: The data is provided by career history interviews with 36 UK graduates.

The device was experimentally optimized using water for high mixing efficiency and a low pressure drop over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re = 0.1\u2013117.6) by varying geometrical parameters such as the number of rhombi, the distance between obstacles and the contraction width. Due to the large amount of data generated, statistical methods were used to facilitate and improve the results of the analysis. The results revealed a rank of factors influencing mixing efficiency: Reynolds number > number of rhombi > contraction width > inter-obstacles distance. The pressure drop measured after three rhombi depends mainly on Re and inter-obstacle distance. The resulting optimum geometry for the low Re regime has a contraction width of 101 μm and inter-obstacles distance of 93 μm, while for the high Re regime a contraction width of 400 μm and inter-obstacle distance of 121 μm are more appropriate. These mixers enabled 80% mixing efficiency creating a pressure drop of 6.0 Pa at Re = 0.1 and 5.1 × 104 Pa at Re = 117.6, with a mixer length of 2.5 mm.

Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme. Even though field-related and voluntary work experience helps graduates to realize a fast integration into the labour market, it is not linked to higher chances for entering a favourable class position or to higher wages in the long run.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"89","weight":0.175,"docData":{"date":"05\/01\/18","money":"399","wordCount":"80","university":"C","abstract":"Digital Marketplace is a market-based framework in which a network selection mechanism is facilitated through a variant of procurement first-price sealed-bid auction; that is, wireless network operators bid for the right to transport the subscriber\u2019s requested service over their infrastructure.

Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced. This paper uses data collected in 2006 from 280 households in Glasgow and Edinburgh to analyse the relationships between urban form and vehicle miles driven, with an emphasis on those who had recently relocated. Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area. Whether or not such intensification can be enacted against a backdrop of preferences towards suburban, car oriented living is contentious. As such, this study calls into question the use of planning policy as a means to reduce car use in Scottish cities.","title":"The influence of urban form on car travel following residential relocation: a current and retrospective study in Scottish urban areas","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"389","weight":0.0435,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/18","money":"432","wordCount":"47","university":"A","abstract":"Offences which are required to be jointly reported to the Procurator Fiscal (PF) and the Children\u2019s Reporter can be found here.

Conventional wisdom has suggested that such an approach can only amount to a compromise solution between accuracy and efficiency. In this work, however, we prove that the original SPC and the further introduced gradient-based SPC can provide robust solution to zero-mean and non-zero-mean noise, and the latter is also used to model the interference term of non-overlapped regions. Comprehensive results from synthetic data and MRI images have fully validated our methodology.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"647","weight":0.0195,"docData":{"date":"16\/05\/19","money":"449","wordCount":"208","university":"A","abstract":"An ancestral legacy is often viewed as the epitome of heritage tourism (McCain, 2003) and can generate the feelings of personal attachment craved by many tourists (Timothy and Boyd, 2006).

McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.

The measured acceleration vectors are transformed into the frequency domain and then used to define a trajectory matrix. The covariance matrix of the trajectory matrix is decomposed into new variables, the Principal Components (PCs). They define a new space of linearly correlated variables onto which the dynamics\/motion of the system can be projected. This decomposition is used to uncover oscillation patterns among other purposes. The method is applied and demonstrated for the case of a simple 2-DoF system.

Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010). Here, we examine the highly gendered and heteronormative \u201Crole models,\u201D \u201Cmentors,\u201D and (familial) mediations experienced by young lesbian Christians, as intersecting public\u2013private domains in the production of queer religious subjectivity and dis-identification.","title":"Making space for young lesbians in church?

This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines. Similarly, system designers can devise interfaces that suit students' needs.","title":"Student search behaviour in an online public access catalogue: an examination of 'searching mental models' and 'searcher self-concept'","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"131","weight":0.0047,"docData":{"date":"08\/06\/19","money":"969","wordCount":"225","university":"C","abstract":"The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave (GW) astrophysics communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect GWs emitted from merging binary black holes (BBH) and recover their parameters with next-generation GW observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.","title":"The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations","authors":"H & L"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":20.0,"label":"market"},{"weight":19.0,"label":"labour"},{"weight":17.0,"label":"career"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"boundary"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"graduate"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"experience"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"obstacle"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"distance"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"wisdom"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"mix"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"contraction"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"preference"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"history"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"demand"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"number"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"keyne"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"unemployment"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"width"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"start"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"inter"}],"topicIndex":72,"mainTopicIds":["4","12","0"]},{"topicId":"73","topDocs":[{"docId":"420","weight":0.8174,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/15","money":"242","wordCount":"115","university":"A","abstract":"Performance of a bolted flange joint is characterized mainly due to its \u2018strength\u2019 and \u2018sealing capability\u2019.

It can be assumed that the stress distribution inside the muscles is the superposition of stresses along the fibres and the connective tissues. The mechanical behaviour of the surrounding tissues is determined by adopting a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model, while the mechanical description of fibres is considered to be the sum of active and passive stresses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, evaluation of the Jacobian matrix is carried out in order to subsequently utilise the standard Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and to carry out time integration with an implicit scheme. The proposed methodology is implemented into our in-house, open source, finite element software, which is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental measurements and other numerical results.

To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation.

The method accounts for the effects of corrosion on the stiffness, maximum strength, residual strength, and failure mode of the bond between the steel and concrete. In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate.

However, this extreme accuracy is also a curse: A datatype is the combination of a structuring medium together with a special purpose logic. These domain-specific logics hamper any attempt to reuse code across similarly structured data. In this paper, we capitalise on the structural invariants of datatypes. To do so, we first adapt the notion of ornament to our universe of inductive families. We then show how code reuse can be achieved by ornamenting functions.

The motion of the particles in a differentially heated cavity is considered where the vertical walls are subject to a temperature difference δ. T whereas horizontal walls are assumed to be adiabatic. Depending on the fluid Grashof number different flow regimes and two critical Grashof numbers are identified. Sustained motion of the suspended particles is also studied and different behaviour is observed compared to the limiting case of tracer particles where simulations are usually performed using one-way coupled point-particle assumptions. Finally the effects of the particles on the heat transfer from the hot wall are studied and it is found that addition of large particles can adversely influence the heat transfer rate. However, if hot particles are effectively removed from the wall, e.g. by increasing the Grashof number, wall heat transfer properties can still be enhanced.","title":"Fully resolved simulation of particle deposition and heat transfer in a differentially heated cavity","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"433","weight":0.25,"docData":{"date":"29\/06\/19","money":"428","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Offshore wind power is becoming an important topic of the world's renewable energy research.

Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"81","weight":0.375,"docData":{"date":"20\/05\/19","money":"662","wordCount":"80","university":"B","abstract":"The ability to rapidly switch between orbital angular momentum modes of light has important implications for future classical and quantum systems.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined.

During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived.

Doing so is regarded as a way of meeting individual needs and improving academic standards. Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective \u2013 and potentially antagonistic - social identities.","title":"Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"485","weight":0.2408,"docData":{"date":"26\/01\/18","money":"883","wordCount":"108","university":"B","abstract":"There has been growing interest in alternative assessment strategies that focus on student participation within higher education over the past 20 years.

Education for Citizenship, as opposed to Citizenship Education, in Scotland is not a discrete subject; the objective is that citizenship permeates everything that happens throughout school, academically and socially. It is centrally situated alongside children becoming \u2018effective contributors\u2019, \u2018successful learners\u2019 and \u2018confident individuals\u2019. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of Community of Philosophical Inquiry (CoPI) as a pedagogical tool to enhance citizenship attributes in Scottish children in a range of educational settings. In order, first, to get an insight into the teachers\u2019 perspectives on the Education for Citizenship agenda in Scotland, the teachers were asked for their definitions of \u2018citizen\u2019. Similarly, the children were also asked about their notion of \u2018citizen\u2019. The children\u2019s group betrayed a more political understanding of \u2018citizen\u2019 than the teachers. Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as \u2018informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues\u2019. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children\u2019s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI. The article uses contributions from the children to highlight areas of their lives within school and in society beyond school, where\ndoing philosophy has had an impact. The implications both for education for citizenship and the potential of Philosophy with Children to contribute to an enhanced school curriculum will also be discussed.","title":"Community of philosophical inquiry:  citizenship in Scottish classrooms","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"114","weight":0.1291,"docData":{"date":"15\/03\/18","money":"700","wordCount":"63","university":"B","abstract":"This article considers the path of social policy and democracy in Australia and the latest set of welfare reforms under Labor.

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"72","weight":0.055,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/15","money":"203","wordCount":"92","university":"E","abstract":"Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013) was the United Kingdom's prime minister from 1979 to 1990.

In programming languages, John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields \"free\" theorems about programs just from their types. In physics, Emmy Noether showed that if the action of a physical system is invariant under change of coordinates, then the physical system has a conserved quantity: a quantity that remains constant for all time. Knowledge of conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems. For example, the conservation of energy is by Noether's theorem a consequence of a system's invariance under time-shifting.\n\nIn this paper, we link Reynolds' relational parametricity with Noether's theorem for deriving conserved quantities. We propose an extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms of their Lagrangians. We show, by constructing a relationally parametric model of our extension of Fω, that relational parametricity is enough to satisfy the hypotheses of Noether's theorem, and so to derive conserved quantities for free, directly from the polymorphic types of Lagrangians expressed in our system.","title":"From parametricity to conservation laws, via Noether's Theorem","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"645","weight":0.0079,"docData":{"date":"14\/06\/19","money":"556","wordCount":"128","university":"B","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to explore the reaction of customer facing staff and their attitude to the introduction of high profile corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes; in particular their level of awareness and willingness to implement them.\nConducted using a series of site visits and interviews with managers working within the licensed trade, this was followed up with structured interviews of \"front line\" staff.\nDespite high levels of awareness of both the social problems relating to alcohol consumption and the legislative changes, engagement with operational CSR was limited and often disinterested.

The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"157","weight":0.0071,"docData":{"date":"31\/07\/16","money":"291","wordCount":"142","university":"B","abstract":"This report examines the experiences of Employment Tribunal (ET) claimants after an ET award was made in their favour.

Adding oxymethylene ethers (OMEs) in conventional diesel fuel has the potential to reduce soot formation during the combustion in a diesel engine. OMEs are downstream products of syngas, which can be generated by the gasification of biomass. In this research, a thermodynamic analysis has been conducted through development of data intensive process models of all the unit operations involved in production of OMEs from biomass. Based on the developed model, the key process parameters affecting the OMEs production including equivalence ratio, H2\/CO ratio, and extra water flow rate were identified. This was followed by development of an optimal process design for high OMEs production. It was found that for a fluidized bed gasifier with heat capacity of 28 MW, the conditions for highest OMEs production are at an air amount of 317 tonne\/day, at H2\/CO ratio of 2.1, and without extra water injection. At this level, the total OMEs production is 55 tonne\/day (13 tonne\/day OME3 and 9 tonne\/day OME4).

A skeletal mechanism involving 49 reactions and 15 species, and a 5-step reduced mechanism with 9 species, are used in order to evaluate the performance of the reduced mechanism under turbulent conditions. The 5-step mechanism incurs significantly lower computational expenses compared to the skeletal mechanism. The majority of species mean mass fractions and mean reaction rates computed using these two mechanisms are in good agreement with one another. The mean progress variable and heat release rate variations across the flame brush are also recovered by the reduced mechanism. No major differences are observed in flame response to curvature or strain effects induced by turbulence, although some differences are observed in instantaneous flame structure. These differences are studied using a correlation coefficient and detailed analysis suggests that this comes from the fluctuating heat release induced effects in the case with higher turbulence level.

To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC\/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.","title":"High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"123","weight":0.3,"docData":{"date":"16\/01\/19","money":"253","wordCount":"86","university":"C","abstract":"The OxyCAP-UK (Oxyfuel Combustion - Academic Programme for the UK) programme was a £2 M collaboration involving researchers from seven UK universities, supported by E.On and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased.

To further verify the accuracy of results from CO2 absorption experiment, simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the CO2 absorption and solidification processes is carried out, including system modelling and meshing, reactions simulating and post-CFD treatments. Eulerian multiphase model and species transport model are applied for the simulation. These models will present the interaction between gas phase (CO2) and chemical solution in both physical phase interactions and chemical reactions between the species. The mass fractions of Na2CO3 in solution are monitored during the absorption process. Conclusions has been reached that the simulation results have a good agreement with the experiment results.","title":"CFD simulations of absorption reaction in carbon solidification processes","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"152","weight":0.0993,"docData":{"date":"15\/08\/16","money":"116","wordCount":"135","university":"D","abstract":"Biomimetic compounds based upon the active subsite of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme system have been the focus of much attention as catalysts for hydrogen production: a clean energy vector. Until recently, use of hydrogenase subsite systems for light-driven hydrogen production has typically required the involvement of a photosensitizer, but the molecule [(μ-pdt)(μ-H)Fe2(CO)4(dppv)]+, (1; dppv = cis-1,2-C2H2(PPh2)2; pdt = 1,3-propanedithiolate) has been reported to catalyze the evolution of hydrogen gas under sensitizer-free conditions. Establishing the molecular mechanism that leads to photohydrogen production by 1 is thus an important step that may enable further development of this family of molecules as solar fuel platforms. Here, we report ultrafast UVpump\u2013IRprobe spectroscopy of 1 at three different excitation wavelengths and in a range of solvents, including under the conditions required for H2 production. Combining spectroscopic measurements of the photochemistry and vibrational relaxation dynamics of 1 with ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that, irrespective of experimental conditions, near-instantaneous carbonyl ligand loss is the main photochemical channel. No evidence for a long-lived excited electronic state was found. These results provide the first time-resolved data for the photochemistry of 1 and offer an alternative interpretation of the underlying mechanism of light-driven hydrogen generation.","title":"Investigation of the ultrafast dynamics occurring during unsensitized photocatalytic H2 evolution by an [FeFe]-hydrogenase subsite analogue","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"38","weight":0.0991,"docData":{"date":"17\/02\/18","money":"773","wordCount":"111","university":"B","abstract":"A number of organisms and organelles are capable of self-propulsion at the micro- and nanoscales.

We demonstrate the propulsion of particles based on catalytically controlled molecular self-assembly and fiber formation at the particle surface. Specifically, phosphatase enzymes (acting as the engine) are conjugated to a quantum dot (the vehicle), and are subsequently exposed to micellar aggregates (fuel) that upon biocatalytic dephosphorylation undergo fibrillar self-assembly, which in turn causes propulsion. The motion of individual enzyme\/quantum dot conjugates is followed directly using fluorescence microscopy. While overall movement remains random, the enzymeconjugates exhibit significantly faster transport in the presence of the fiber forming system, compared to controls without fuel, a non-self-assembling substrate, or a substrate which assembles into spherical, rather than fibrous structures upon enzymatic dephosphorylation. When increasing the concentration of the fiber-forming fuel, the speed of the conjugates increases compared to non-self-assembling substrate, although directionality remains random.","title":"Nanopropulsion by biocatalytic self-assembly","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"263","weight":0.0732,"docData":{"date":"12\/03\/18","money":"628","wordCount":"164","university":"D","abstract":"Various plants have the ability to follow the sun with their flowers or leaves during the course of a day via a mechanism known as heliotropism. This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations. Example applications of this lightweight shape changing structure include concentrators, mirrors, and communications antennas that are able to dynamically change their focal point, as well as substructures for solar sails that are capable of steering through solar winds by altering the sails׳ subjected area.","title":"Inflatable shape changing colonies assembling versatile smart space structures","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"411","weight":0.0572,"docData":{"date":"05\/07\/15","money":"674","wordCount":"106","university":"D","abstract":"Implementing the smart grid requires coordinating competing objectives and constraints from multiple engineering domains.

A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical extraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques provided direct evidence that Tc(VII) was reduced and incorporated into the magnetite structure. Subsequent air oxidation of the magnetite particles for up to 152 days resulted in only limited remobilization of the incorporated Tc(IV).

On reoxidation in air, the incorporated Tc(IV) was recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution with less than 40% remobilization to solution despite significant oxidation of the magnetite to maghemite\/goethite: All solid associated Tc remained as Tc(IV). The results of this study provide the first direct evidence for significant Tc(IV) incorporation into the magnetite structure and confirm that magnetite incorporated Tc(IV) is recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"550","weight":0.0159,"docData":{"date":"25\/04\/18","money":"438","wordCount":"128","university":"B","abstract":"This article is a case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in the lives of young lesbians in the United Kingdom.

We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.","title":"Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"500","weight":0.5255,"docData":{"date":"07\/02\/18","money":"477","wordCount":"119","university":"A","abstract":"Development of robust yeast strains that can efficiently ferment lignocellulose-based feedstocks is one of the requirements for achieving economically feasible bioethanol production processes.

The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"749","weight":0.0946,"docData":{"date":"16\/07\/16","money":"745","wordCount":"74","university":"A","abstract":"Discovery of new catalysts for demanding aqueous reactions is challenging.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"546","weight":0.0273,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/19","money":"485","wordCount":"147","university":"B","abstract":"Recent progress in the field of genetic engineering has opened up the door to novel synthetic biology applications. Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"363","weight":0.0247,"docData":{"date":"19\/09\/19","money":"880","wordCount":"81","university":"C","abstract":"We study the thermalization of excitations generated by spontaneous emission events for cold bosons in an optical lattice.

Because spontaneous emissions lead effectively to a local quantum quench, this behavior is strongly dependent on the low-energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian, and undergoes a qualitative change at the Mott insulator-superfluid transition point.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":17.0,"label":"strain"},{"weight":12.0,"label":"gene"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"aeruginosa"},{"weight":11.0,"label":"isolate"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"infection"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"genomic"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"show"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"previously"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"identify"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"pseudomonas"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"phenotype"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"activity"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"genetic"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"production"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"bacteriocin"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"regulatory"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"host"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"binding"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"disease"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"describe"}],"topicIndex":77,"mainTopicIds":["2","7","0"]},{"topicId":"78","topDocs":[{"docId":"311","weight":0.5461,"docData":{"date":"29\/05\/18","money":"701","wordCount":"152","university":"D","abstract":"An evidence-led scientific case for development of a space-based polar remote sensing platform at geostationary-like (GEO-like) altitudes is developed through methods including a data user survey. Whilst a GEO platform provides a near static perspective, multiple platforms are required to provide circumferential coverage. Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous. Users also find the placement of apogee over the pole to be preferable to the alternative scenarios. Thus, a clear majority of data users find the \u201CTaranis\u201D orbit concept to be better than a critical inclination orbit, due to the improved perspective offered. The geophysical products that would benefit from a GEO-like polar platform are mainly estimated from radiances in the visible\/near infrared and thermal parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is consistent with currently proven technologies from GEO. Based on the survey results, needs analysis, and current technology proven from GEO, scientific and observation requirements are developed along with two instrument concepts with eight and four channels, based on Flexible Combined Imager heritage.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"608","weight":0.38,"docData":{"date":"12\/09\/16","money":"910","wordCount":"52","university":"E","abstract":"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a reliable neuropsychological assessment, but major barriers are still encountered when such tests are used across cultures and during the lifespan.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.","title":"Quantum trajectories and open many-body quantum systems","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"541","weight":0.284,"docData":{"date":"07\/02\/16","money":"817","wordCount":"81","university":"D","abstract":"For smart grid development, one of the key expectations is that the data should be accessible to and readily interpreted by different applications.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"723","weight":0.269,"docData":{"date":"30\/08\/16","money":"717","wordCount":"124","university":"C","abstract":"Two-dimensional metasurface structures have recently been proposed to reduce the challenges of fabrication of traditional plasmonic metamaterials. However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.","title":"Highly anisotropic metasurface: a polarized beam splitter and hologram","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"741","weight":0.2667,"docData":{"date":"06\/11\/16","money":"418","wordCount":"30","university":"D","abstract":"The Project Macmillan Exploratory aimed to discover how asthma care could benefit from augmented reality by reviewing existing evidence (patient surveys, professional feedback, etc.) and discussing the future direction of asthma treatment, including how to further develop adherence behaviour.","title":"Project Macmillan Exploratory Report","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"492","weight":0.266,"docData":{"date":"14\/02\/19","money":"772","wordCount":"94","university":"E","abstract":"Global production of composite materials in 2015 will significantly exceed 10 million tons.

SPF ceramic dies have a lower production cost than conventional metal tools, and have short leadtimes, but their brittle nature is a limiting factor for SPF applications. Suitable surface treatments have a remarkable effect on wear resistance; hence, the working surface of the die can be improved by the application of appropriate coatings, increasing the lifetime of the SPF ceramic dies. Thermal spray is a promising deposition method, since numerous coating solutions are achievable without expensive vacuum technology. This paper describes a method for the investigation of surface degradation mechanisms in ceramic dies during SPF process at laboratory scale. Greater emphasis is given to the application of thermal sprayed coatings and quantification of their protection properties. At the Advanced Forming Research Centre is been designed a dedicated test rig used for simulate the die part interface at SPF condition.

You reach the darkest point when you are in the deepest. Then, as you start your way out, there is gradually more and more light. Over the last quarter century we were getting deeper and deeper in. It seems that it is starting to get lighter now.\n\nAs academics and consultants we have been working for, with and on top-level business decision takers involved in loosely structured decision problems. Gradually we have achieved better and better understanding of the models of thinking that can be useful for these decision takers. First we realized that the model of thinking needs to be simple; which is the philosophical commonplace of Occam\u2019s razor. Somewhat later we realized that it is easy to cut our-selves if Occam\u2019s razor is too sharp \u2013 the model of thinking must not be too simple as it will fail to provide a usable representation of reality. This is also known from philosophy as Einstein\u2019s extension of Occam\u2019s rule: as simple as possible but not simpler than that.

This way we started building the bridge of trans-disciplinarity between the knowledge do-mains of various experts. However, this bridge is narrow and difficult to use for crossing the disciplinary divides. Decision takers cannot walk the bridge alone; they need a bridge-guide called the knowledge engineer. The knowledge engineer is not a polymath (expert in multiple domains); the knowledge engineer\u2019s expertise is about knowledge and knowers.\n\nMore recently we have realized that it is not sufficient if the model is useful, it also has to be usable.

D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations).

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"707","weight":0.0604,"docData":{"date":"31\/05\/16","money":"743","wordCount":"119","university":"A","abstract":"The research paper in hand presents a thorough exploration of the fishing vessel accidents and near misses in the UK fishing industry as well as the underlying human element factors and sub-factors contributing to them.

Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Differences between groups were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. Conclusions: Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening programme, offering considerable potential for risk reduction of disease in older adults.","title":"The impact of a bodyweight and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening programme: randomised controlled trial","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"258","weight":0.0125,"docData":{"date":"13\/05\/17","money":"269","wordCount":"83","university":"B","abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging modality to extract tumour regions to assist in radiotherapy and surgery planning.

The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"30","weight":0.008,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/18","money":"270","wordCount":"126","university":"C","abstract":"Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is believed to be accompanied by increased activation of the sensory and motor cortices.

P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by endogenous nucleotides, such as ATP and UTP. A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":13.0,"label":"curve"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"pepc"},{"weight":10.0,"label":"earthquake"},{"weight":9.0,"label":"knowledge"},{"weight":8.0,"label":"event"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"metabolism"},{"weight":7.0,"label":"ground"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"resveratrol"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"bridge"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"variability"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"region"},{"weight":6.0,"label":"record"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"engineer"},{"weight":5.0,"label":"conformation"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"phosphorylation"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"disallow"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"sphingolipid"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"seismic"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"hazard"},{"weight":4.0,"label":"simpler"}],"topicIndex":79,"mainTopicIds":["16","7","0"]},{"topicId":"80","topDocs":[{"docId":"309","weight":0.5586,"docData":{"date":"23\/02\/19","money":"573","wordCount":"111","university":"C","abstract":"A model is presented for the thickening of a raked suspension.

This floc densification opens up channels between the flocs through which liquid escapes, making the suspension easier to dewater. The densification theory presented here predicts profiles of varying solids fraction vs height in the settling zone in a thickener, information which is not normally available when designing thickeners via the conventional Kynch theory. Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux. As underflow solids fraction is increased, thickeners operated at a specified aggregate densification rate (or equivalently at a fixed settling zone height) tend to approach a 'fully densified' suspension state (defined as a point at which the extent of aggregate densification ceases to change with time), with improved thickening performance.","title":"Effects of aggregate densification upon thickening of Kynchian suspensions","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"697","weight":0.5532,"docData":{"date":"22\/08\/15","money":"832","wordCount":"95","university":"B","abstract":"Ocean acidification is altering the oceanic carbonate saturation state and threatening the survival of marine calcifying organisms.

After six months of incubation at 750≈ atm pCO 2, reduced carbonic anhydrase protein activity and shell growth occurs in M. edulis. Beyond that, at 1000≈ atm pCO 2, biomineralisation continued but with compensated metabolism of proteins and increased calcite growth.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"282","weight":0.4685,"docData":{"date":"18\/10\/16","money":"257","wordCount":"111","university":"C","abstract":"Legislative professionalism has played a prominent role in state politics research for decades.

We evaluate the internal consistency of professionalism components over time, the relationship between components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling. We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating multidimensional measures.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans.

The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"35","weight":0.069,"docData":{"date":"11\/05\/16","money":"521","wordCount":"147","university":"A","abstract":"The location of the Isles of Lewis and Harris, off the west coast of mainland Scotland, is favourable for the generation of renewable electricity from both the wind and ocean waves.

Eight years on, we take a fresh look at the model to consider how well it fits its intended purpose, and how a model framework to inspire future researchers in the field of plant\u2013microbe interactions might develop.","title":"The zigzag model of plant-microbe interactions: is it time to move on?","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"560","weight":0.0205,"docData":{"date":"05\/09\/18","money":"872","wordCount":"98","university":"A","abstract":"Climate change and sustainability have driven enormous development programmes for offshore wind. These large structures are mainly fabricated of welded steel tubular and plate sections not dissimilar to structural details commonly encountered in the ship, and offshore oil and gas sectors, but design requirements differ significantly due to environmental aspects, loading regime and low capital expenditure and operational expenditure requirements. There is therefore a requirement to quickly update corrosion fatigue knowledge and data bases in order to assist operations and designers to optimise structures with respect to fatigue strength and cost. This paper reviews seawater corrosion fatigue and potential approaches to developing appropriate test procedures and analysis methods to produce reliable and meaningful corrosion-fatigue behaviour under stochastic loading conditions and sets out some fundamental principles for any such testing programme.","title":"A framework for variable amplitude corrosion fatigue materials tests for offshore wind steel support structures","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"332","weight":0.0146,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/17","money":"463","wordCount":"137","university":"D","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to highlight the curiously circular course followed by mainstream macroeconomic thinking in recent times. Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"290","weight":0.0126,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/18","money":"166","wordCount":"163","university":"C","abstract":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of fatal chronic lung infections among individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). During the past 15 years, particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified, initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and\/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.","title":"Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"503","weight":0.0122,"docData":{"date":"11\/07\/15","money":"890","wordCount":"82","university":"D","abstract":"This exploratory study attempts to shed some light on the ethnocentric behaviours of young Iranians in relation to the global consumer culture.

Furthermore, as the case law analysis demonstrates, the traditional hierarchy of rights by which civil and political rights were prioritised over their economic and social counterparts, has given way to an EU legal order whereby the economic imperative remains paramount with social provisions, in the context of labour rights, subjugated and subject to further divisions.","title":"The EU and the ECHR: collective and non-discrimination labour rights at a crossroad?","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"609","weight":0.5132,"docData":{"date":"08\/06\/16","money":"260","wordCount":"76","university":"C","abstract":"Traditionally, labour lawyers have held that there is a strict dichotomy between employment and commercial law; they regulate relationships which are different in nature and underpinned by different values.

It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services.

While the facts of Femarbel and Ottica do not bear much resemblance to each other, the judgments illustrate that the definition of what falls under the umbrella of healthcare services is not always obvious. Moreover, the cases provide a timely example of attempts by commercial interest groups to use EU law to open up domestic healthcare markets to private, commercial service providers. As such, the judgments have the potential to provide more clarity on the scope of the Directive 2006\/123 on services in the internal market (\"the Services Directive\") and Member States' discretion in regulating healthcare provision in their territory.

Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?

Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally.

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment.

A significant portion of the recrystallization process was concluded to have occurred after pulsing; i.e., during cooling to ambient temperature. The grain structure and microhardness were shown to vary noticeably in the heat-affected zone (HAZ); these observations mirrored variations of temper colors. Accordingly, the revealed microstructure heterogeneity was attributed to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution developed during pulsing. In the central part of the HAZ, the mean grain size increased with current density and this effect was associated with the temperature rise per se.

To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"39","weight":0.2639,"docData":{"date":"01\/09\/17","money":"130","wordCount":"72","university":"C","abstract":"Weld cladding is investigated using a nickel alloy clad on a high strength low alloy carbon steel substrate.

The local temperature is found to be higher at the inner sides of the multi-tip tool cutting edges than the outer sides. Applying centro-symmetry parameters and radius distribution function, the local annealing process and its effect on the integrity of the machined nanostructures are analyzed. It is observed that the local annealing at the machined surface can improve the surface integrity of the machined nanostructures, especially in the multi-tip diamond tool cutting process.

The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation.

GC-DTPA-Gd conjugates of precisely controlled MWs were synthesised and evaluated in mice against Gd-DTPA using time series of high-resolution MRI images of trunk, head, and xenograft flank tumours. GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD). The kidneys showed early enhancement also, particularly in the renal pelvis, suggesting renal elimination. Imaging of the head with GC-DTPA-Gd allowed detailed anatomical identification of specific blood vessels in particular with the high MW CA agent. Sequential, high-resolution, isotropic imaging of established A431 xenograft flank tumours with DTPA-Gd and GC-DTPA-Gd demonstrated that the initial distribution of the contrast agents was well correlated with blood vessels and supply. In contrast, subsequent tissue transport was primarily by diffusion and limited by CA molecular weight. The data also highlight the role of heterogeneity in CA distribution which was more prominent for the high MW agent. Precise control of glycol chitosan (GC) polymer chemistry facilitates synthesis of a family of Gd-based MRI contrast agents of tuneable MW but otherwise identical physicochemical properties.

The polyelectrolyte-wrapped nanorod-dye conjugates were also found to be highly stable as well as non-cytotoxic. To demonstrate the use of these universal tags for the multimodal optical imaging of biological specimens, confocal Raman and fluorescence maps of stained immune cells following nanoparticle uptake were acquired at several excitation wavelengths and compared with dark-field images.

Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as \u2018informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues\u2019. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children\u2019s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI. The article uses contributions from the children to highlight areas of their lives within school and in society beyond school, where\ndoing philosophy has had an impact. The implications both for education for citizenship and the potential of Philosophy with Children to contribute to an enhanced school curriculum will also be discussed.","title":"Community of philosophical inquiry:  citizenship in Scottish classrooms","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.0228,"docData":{"date":"23\/02\/15","money":"285","wordCount":"147","university":"C","abstract":"Biased agonism describes a multi-state model of G protein-coupled receptor activation in which each ligand induces a unique structural conformation of the receptor, such that the receptor couples differentially to G proteins and other intracellular proteins. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by endogenous nucleotides, such as ATP and UTP. A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"729","weight":0.0184,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/18","money":"359","wordCount":"109","university":"A","abstract":"Despite increasing policy emphasis on developing and retaining an aging workforce, this paper demonstrates employer use of electronic performance monitoring (EPM) as part of performance management which can adversely affect older workers.

This implies that usually one cannot obtain bright betatron X-rays and high-quality electron beams with low emittance and small energy spread simultaneously in the same accelerating wave bucket. Here, we report the first (to our knowledge) experimental observation of two distinct electron bunches in a single laser shot, one featured with quasi-monoenergetic spectrum and another with continuous spectrum along with large emittance. The latter is able to generate high-flux betatron X-rays. Such is observed only when the laser self-guiding is extended over 4 mm at a fixed plasma density (4 × 1018 cm-3). Numerical simulation reveals that two bunches of electrons are injected at different stages due to the bubble evolution. The first bunch is injected at the beginning to form a stable quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, whereas the second one is injected later due to the oscillation of the bubble size as a result of the change of the laser spot size during the propagation. Due to the inherent temporal synchronization, this unique electron-photon source can be ideal for pump-probe applications with femtosecond time resolution.","title":"Concurrence of monoenergetic electron beams and bright X-rays from an evolving laser-plasma bubble","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"175","weight":0.7106,"docData":{"date":"30\/11\/17","money":"484","wordCount":"82","university":"A","abstract":"We previously proposed a dual FEL configuration on the UV Demo FEL at\nJefferson Lab that would allow simultaneous lasing at FIR and UV wavelengths [1].

Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response.

The plasma is formed just below the reflection point of the ordinary wave mode, where Langmuir and\nupper hybrid turbulence take place. When the plasma builds up, the radio wave is reflected at a lower altitude, and an ionization front is formed, rapidly descending to an altitude a few tens of kilometres below the initial critical layer. The ionization of the neutral gas is attributed to collisions with energetic electrons accelerated by the plasma wave turbulence. Numerical full-scale modeling of the Langmuir turbulence, electron acceleration and transport, and ionization processes are consistent with the observations. By a similarity principle, the experiment can be scaled down from the large-scale ionosphere to a metre-scale laboratory plasma, where microwaves are used instead of radio waves to induce the plasma turbulence. Such laboratory experiments under controlled conditions are now planned at Strathclyde, and may lead to new methods for electron acceleration and plasma generation in the laboratory.","title":"Electron acceleration and ionization fronts induced by high frequency plasma turbulence","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"580","weight":0.2174,"docData":{"date":"30\/11\/18","money":"918","wordCount":"46","university":"A","abstract":"We report experimental evidence of spontaneous formation of localized structures in a 80μm diameter Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) biased above the lasing threshold and under optical injection.

Mass spectrometry-based approaches are commonly used to analyze protein phosphorylation, but such analysis is challenging, largely due to the low phosphorylation stoichiometry. Hence, a number of phosphopeptide enrichment strategies have been developed, including metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). Here, we describe a new material for performing MOAC that employs a magnetite-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), that is suitable for the creation of microwell array and microfluidic systems to enable low volume, high throughput analysis. Incubation time and sample loading were explored and optimized and demonstrate that the embedded magnetite is able to enrich phosphopeptides.

However, this method requires an accurate radiation condition to ensure that the waves propagate away from the ship. Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.","title":"A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"522","weight":0.4877,"docData":{"date":"08\/09\/15","money":"696","wordCount":"124","university":"B","abstract":"Following recent attempts to quantify articulatory impairment in speech, we evaluate the usefulness of a novel measure of motor stability to characterise dysarthria.  We investigated 8 speakers with ataxic dysarthria (AD), 16 speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) as a result of Parkinson's Disease and 24 unimpaired control participants. Each participant performed a series of sentence repetitions under habitual, fast and slow speaking rate conditions. We used an algorithm to measure utterance-to-utterance spectro-temporal variation (UUV; Cummins, 2009). Speech rate and intelligibility were also measured.  UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the ataxic, but not the HD groups, presumably due to differences in intelligibility in the samples employed, and not to differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared to habitual and fast speaking rates.  UUV results are consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way. The results suggest that the UUV could be developed into an easy to use clinical tool that could function as a valid and reliable assessment and outcome measure.","title":"The quantitative assessment of interutterance stability: application to dysarthric speech","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"643","weight":0.4355,"docData":{"date":"16\/02\/19","money":"743","wordCount":"124","university":"D","abstract":"Disordered speech can present with rhythmic problems, impacting on an individual\u2019s ability to communicate. Effective treatment relies on the availability of sensitive methods to characterise the problem. Rhythm metrics based on segmental durations originally designed for crosslinguistic research have the potential to provide such information. However, these measures may be associated with problems that impact on their clinical usefulness. This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech.  The paper concludes that the underlying speech impairment leading to the perceptual and acoustic characterisation of rhythmic problems needs to be established through detailed analysis of speech characteristics in order to construct effective treatment plans for individuals with speech disorders.","title":"Quantification of rhythm problems in disordered speech: a re-evaluation","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"782","weight":0.2174,"docData":{"date":"12\/11\/16","money":"898","wordCount":"70","university":"B","abstract":"The paper investigates the mechanism of instability of deepwater risers fitted with fairings and presents an analytical model to predict the instability onset conditions.

Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?
