Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the last 6 quarters. In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter. The favourable gap between Scotland and UK manufacturing performance during the recovery therefore continues to be large. In Scottish construction whi le growth in the sector has picked up since the heavy recession period of 2010q4 to 2012q1 performance appears to have weakened relative to the UK from the start of last year. The sector is still very much depressed in both the UK and Scotland. However, the recent stronger performance of UK construction is evident with GVA in the sector in the third quarter -10.9% below its pre -recession peak compared to -13.6% in Scotland. Business and financial services continue to contribute positively to the growth of t he Scottish economy. By the latest quarter, the sector in the UK had moved to +1.3% above its pre-recession peak from -0.4% in the previous quarter, while its Scottish counterpart moved further ahead to stand at 2.2% above its pre-recession peak.

This resistance was carried further by the Scottish Covenanters fighting and winning the Bishops\u2019 Wars in 1639-40 and then exporting their revolution through armed intervention in Ireland from 1642 and in England from 1644. The Scottish Covenanters\u2019 alliance with the English Parliamentarians was formalised by the Solemn League and Covenant which again sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy throughout the three Stuart kingdoms. But these events cannot be viewed solely as British and Irish Civil Wars. They must be contextualised in relation to the Thirty Years War and particularly to the determination of France under both Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin to supplant the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs as the foremost European power. While much work has recently been done on the diplomatic links of the principal protagonists in the Civil Wars, the importance of France to Scottish Covenanters, English Parliamentarians and Irish Confederates in their tangled and tortuous relationships among themselves and with Charles I remains relatively underworked. This article does not attempt a comprehensive review, but sketches out the intricacies of Covenanting exchanges with the French Court before all prospects of a revived \u2018auld alliance\u2019 were crushed by the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell and his English regicides in 1651.","title":"Covenanting exchanges with the French court during the wars for the three kingdoms","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"87","weight":0.8733,"docData":{"date":"17\/04\/19","money":"415","wordCount":"71","university":"A","abstract":"The business surveys reviewed in this section provide a barometer for the Scottish economy and outlined below is an overview of key recent evidence.

As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation\u2019s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences. This paper focuses on divergent representations of Rwandan monarchical figures \u2013 often unnamed \u2013 whom the narrators imbue with values according to their individual political affiliations, lived experiences, and identity. These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.","title":"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"9","weight":0.6064,"docData":{"date":"17\/10\/15","money":"194","wordCount":"94","university":"C","abstract":"In the context of healthcare, the ECJ's jurisprudence has recently been clarified and codified in Directive 2011\/24\/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (\"Patients' Mobility Directive\").

Ease of boundary-crossing differed by career stage and educational background. Boundaries enabled career self-management by acting as psychological\/external push factors, but push factors only aided progression to high-skilled segments for a third of graduates who started careers in underemployment. For the rest, an adaptation of expectations to labour market realities was observed.\nResearch limitations\/implications: Although career history interviews limit generalisability, they contextualise boundaries and deepen understanding of career actors\u2019 subjective experiences and responses.   \nPractical implications: The study highlights the role of labour market and demand-side constraints for career transitions as well as proactive career behaviours.

This paper reviews Scottish energy strategy since 1999 and notes the stronger policy link in recent years between investment in low carbon and renewable energy and related employment growth. The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast. In our view, greater conceptual clarity and a more significant allocation of resources need to be devoted to the measurement of activity and employment in low carbon and renewable activities in Scotland to allow any meaningful evaluation of strategy in this area.","title":"Scotland\u2019s Green Jobs Conundrum: How to Better Measure the Employment Impact of a Low Carbon Future","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"638","weight":0.4884,"docData":{"date":"11\/05\/15","money":"418","wordCount":"86","university":"B","abstract":"Theories often explain intraparty competition based on electoral conditions and intraparty rules.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"464","weight":0.4445,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/17","money":"810","wordCount":"81","university":"E","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a growing focus on promoting the concept of employee-ownership of businesses within public policy.

This paper highlights some of the findings from the first empirical examination of the growth performance of employee-owned businesses (EOBs) ever undertaken in Scotland. The study involved an in-depth examination of a small sample of employee owned firms and a quasi-experimental comparison of these firms against a control group of non-employee owned firms. The study confirms that the performance of EBOs is generally superior to that of non EBOs on a number of different variables. On average, employee-owned firms both employ more staff and exhibit higher turnover growth than their peers.

Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced. This paper uses data collected in 2006 from 280 households in Glasgow and Edinburgh to analyse the relationships between urban form and vehicle miles driven, with an emphasis on those who had recently relocated. Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area. Whether or not such intensification can be enacted against a backdrop of preferences towards suburban, car oriented living is contentious. As such, this study calls into question the use of planning policy as a means to reduce car use in Scottish cities.","title":"The influence of urban form on car travel following residential relocation: a current and retrospective study in Scottish urban areas","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"57","weight":0.4087,"docData":{"date":"13\/11\/15","money":"248","wordCount":"93","university":"B","abstract":"Graduates from higher education often enter the labour market with a considerable amount of work experience.

Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme.

However, the issue of potential spillover effects on energy demand (and supply) from energy efficiency improvements in one region\/nation on others have generally been neglected (Madlener and Alcott, 2009; Sorrell, 2009; Turner, 2013; Van den Bergh, 2011).

This is an important knowledge gap, particularly given the global nature of energy-related climate change and the context of supra-national policy targets such as the EU 20-20-20 framework. The potential for energy efficiency policy actions taken in one country to impact energy use (and related emissions) in others implies that target setting and implementation decisions in different member states may not be regarded as independent.","title":"Beyond national economy-wide rebound effects: an applied general equilibrium analysis incorporating international spillover effects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"119","weight":0.2917,"docData":{"date":"13\/11\/15","money":"402","wordCount":"72","university":"C","abstract":"Econometric analysis has been inconclusive in determining the contribution that increased skills have on macroeconomic performance whilst conventional growth accounting approaches to the same problem rest on restrictive assumptions.

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx\u2019s work on fictitious capital.

According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value \u2013 only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession\u2019s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.

It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned.

This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper.

McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.

Despite the often \u2018cottage industry\u2019 nature of many ancestral attractions (often reliant on volunteers and local \u2018good will) the outcome of the visit can often be greater satisfaction and a strong repeat visitation pattern.","title":"Connecting with the past: meeting the needs of ancestral tourists in Scotland","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"402","weight":0.1301,"docData":{"date":"25\/06\/19","money":"755","wordCount":"123","university":"C","abstract":"Western states are concerned about maintaining and securing national borders.

Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0.07 m that was partly filled with foamed polyurethane. The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services.

India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7\u201337.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846\u2013$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children. Increasing all immunization rates to 90% (intervention two) averts an additional 22.1 (95% UR, 18.6\u201325.7) deaths and $45,914 (95% UR, $37,909\u2013$53,920) OOP expenditure. Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.","title":"Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"279","weight":0.0589,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/15","money":"623","wordCount":"119","university":"C","abstract":"In electricity markets, where conditions are uncertain, the choice of the best technology and the optimisation of production processes may not anymore be enough to ensure optimal investment yield of energy business plans. Providing some aspects of flexibility might enhance their financial performance; fuel switching may prove to be an alternative option, offering operational flexibility over time, as well as significant financial benefits. Traditional investment analysis methods are considered marginally useful to analyse this case. Instead, the recent tools of time-dependent investment analysis are more appropriate, since they are not inherently restricted to immediate, irreversible decisions. In the present work, a time-dependent computational model is presented and applied in the case study of the Greek Power Sector, in order to estimate the potential advantages of the fuel switching concept. Moreover, the optimal timing of switching is derived, to ensure increasing yields of an average-capacity power-plant. The results of the research indicate significant financial benefits anticipated in most scenarios from applying fuel switching, compared to single-fuelled electricity generation units.

In this paper, we argue that the appropriate practice should be to take into account the uncertainty around the WGI estimates through the use of multiple imputation. We investigate the importance of our proposed approach by revisiting in three applications the results of recently published studies. These applications cover the impact of governance on (i) capital flows; (ii) international trade; (iii) income levels around the world. We generally find that the estimated effects of governance are highly sensitive to the use of multiple imputation.

A model for the evolution of the resulting foam front known as \u2018pressure-driven growth\u2019 is analysed. An asymptotic solution of this model for long times is derived that shows that foam can propagate indefinitely into the reservoir without gravity override. Moreover, \u2018pressure-driven growth\u2019 is shown to correspond to a special case of the more general \u2018viscous froth\u2019 model. In particular, it is a singular limit of the viscous froth, corresponding to the elimination of a surface tension term, permitting sharp corners and kinks in the predicted shape of the front. Sharp corners tend to develop from concave regions of the front. The principal solution of interest has a convex front, however, so that although this solution itself has no sharp corners (except for some kinks that develop spuriously owing to errors in a numerical scheme), it is found nevertheless to exhibit milder singularities in front curvature, as the long-time asymptotic analytical solution makes clear. Numerical schemes for the evolving front shape which perform robustly (avoiding the development of spurious kinks) are also developed. Generalisations of this solution to geologically heterogeneous reservoirs should exhibit concavities and\/or sharp corner singularities as an inherent part of their evolution: propagation of fronts containing such \u2018inherent\u2019 singularities can be readily incorporated into these numerical schemes.","title":"Analysis of a model for foam improved oil recovery","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"254","weight":0.0477,"docData":{"date":"04\/05\/15","money":"438","wordCount":"84","university":"B","abstract":"We have measured dielectronic recombination (DR) for Fe12 + forming Fe11 + using the heavy ion storage ring TSR located at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further harmonisation is needed, but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively.

There were many innovations in the field of agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850s and 1860s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the steam plough, with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870s and 1880s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the steam plough in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to have a major impact on rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler\u2019s steam\nplough.What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure.\nThe environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible.

Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.","title":"Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"687","weight":0.0309,"docData":{"date":"10\/09\/16","money":"814","wordCount":"162","university":"A","abstract":"In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of CubeSats to perform research in the realms of microgravity and earth observation. Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.","title":"Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"773","weight":0.0295,"docData":{"date":"08\/07\/15","money":"992","wordCount":"204","university":"A","abstract":"Background: Technological innovations have the potential to strengthen human resources for health and improve access and quality of care in challenging 'post-conflict' contexts. However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.

This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:\n In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?\n Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?\n What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?\nThe attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.\nSince geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to\n2\nhow they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.\nThere are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.\nThis paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.\nThe second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.\nThis paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities. There are multiple organisations which could assist in addressing the diverse needs of communities in increasing Internet access. However, they will need to work together and be responsive to the diverse needs of these communities. The evidence also provides direction for Glasgow City Council on ways to engage the disconnected, move forward with their Digital Strategy and close the Digital chasm that exists in the city.","title":"Internet access among the most income deprived: the case of Glasgow","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"142","weight":0.0189,"docData":{"date":"02\/03\/18","money":"107","wordCount":"159","university":"B","abstract":"The favored pathway for disposal of higher activity radioactive wastes is via deep geological disposal. Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1.5-1.8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20-60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate)-type crystallographic structure. The presented results have clear and hitherto unrecognized implications for the mobility of U(VI) in cementitious environments, in particular those associated with the geological disposal of nuclear waste.

Doing so is regarded as a way of meeting individual needs and improving academic standards. Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective \u2013 and potentially antagonistic - social identities.","title":"Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?","authors":"B &

Square billets were processed using different routes of I-ECAP at temperatures varying from 125 °C to 250 °C. The billets were obtained from commercially available coarse-grained, hot-extruded rod and fine-grained, hot-rolled plate. A strong influence of the initial microstructure on processing temperature was reported. Fine-grained samples were successfully processed at 200 °C, while coarse-grained ones must have been heated up to 250 °C to avoid fracture. A gradual temperature decrease with subsequent passes allowed successful pressing at 150 °C. Processing using various routes of I-ECAP showed that a billet rotation before the last pass had strong influence on mechanical properties.

This reduction in martensite content in the HTHAZ increases the level of ditched structure in cryogenically cooled welds and yields more ferrite-martensite ditched grain boundaries than in conventional welds.

In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate.

Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0.07 m that was partly filled with foamed polyurethane. The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"626","weight":0.5943,"docData":{"date":"24\/02\/18","money":"912","wordCount":"69","university":"D","abstract":"Being very strong and of limited ductility, Ti alloys require special techniques to manufacture the parts with complex shapes.

Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required.

The result of this study shows that although all three interpretations can reasonably predict the maximum sub-cooling over a tested range of cooling rates, the linear assumptions in the Nývlt and Kubota interpretations give increased deviations from the experimental data, in particular for faster cooling rates. In contrast to the two aforementioned models, the population balance based method maintains a minimal deviation across the whole range of cooling rates used.

The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation.

Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"789","weight":0.359,"docData":{"date":"25\/08\/17","money":"879","wordCount":"78","university":"A","abstract":"Corrosion is the gradual deterioration of a material or its properties through a chemical reaction with its environment.

However, if hot particles are effectively removed from the wall, e.g. by increasing the Grashof number, wall heat transfer properties can still be enhanced.","title":"Fully resolved simulation of particle deposition and heat transfer in a differentially heated cavity","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"208","weight":0.1112,"docData":{"date":"11\/10\/18","money":"142","wordCount":"135","university":"E","abstract":"In this paper, the main alternative propulsion plants based on reciprocating internal combustion engines of a ferry or RoRo ship operating in routes that include Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are comparatively assessed.

Usually, in the thermal load calculations, the analysis assumes that the vehicle has a smooth surface. However, discontinuities or imperfections are often present on the aerospace vehicle surfaces due to fabrication tolerances, sensor installations, spaces between the thermal protection plates, and differential expansion or ablation rates between non-similar materials. In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80km in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used. The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality plays a key role in the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4.

Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"318","weight":0.0732,"docData":{"date":"06\/03\/18","money":"508","wordCount":"82","university":"B","abstract":"The Hull Cell was used to investigate the impact of current density j on the morphology and uniformity of zinc electrodeposited from a 2.5 mol dm−3 Zn2+ solution in 1.5 mol dm−3 methanesulfonic acid at 40◦C onto carbon-composite surfaces.

The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations.

For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"400","weight":0.0281,"docData":{"date":"01\/06\/17","money":"776","wordCount":"107","university":"A","abstract":"Alkyl phosphonic acids (CnPA) are becoming a material of choice for passivation of high-k oxides in organic thin-film transistors with ultra-thin gate dielectrics. A monolayer of phosphonic acid inserted between the inorganic oxide and the organic semiconductor provides two main benefits: (i) the density of the charge carrier traps associated with the surface \u2013OH groups of the oxide is reduced because these groups act as binding sites for the organic molecules; and (ii) the low surface energy of the organic monolayer may reduce the density of defects in the subsequently deposited conjugated polymer. To date such monolayers have been assembled from solutions only. We have recently developed a vapour-phase self-assembly of n-octylphosphonic acid (C8PA) monolayer in vacuum that leads to a well chemisorbed monolayer of C8PA. When such a monolayer is attached to ~ 9-nm thick aluminium oxide to form an ultra-thin dielectric implemented in low-voltage organic thin-film transistors based on pentacene, the transistor performance exhibits measurable changes upon alteration of the structure of the C8PA monolayer.","title":"Correlation between the structure of the dielectric monolayer and the performance of low-voltage transistors based on pentacene","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"414","weight":0.0254,"docData":{"date":"05\/08\/15","money":"459","wordCount":"79","university":"B","abstract":"This paper scopes to provide a suggestion on the maintenance outline as perceived from the evaluation of an extended literature review on marine engineering systems and applications sourced from research and \nindustrial studies.

We contribute to this debate by exploring, theoretically and empirically, the role of accounting in shaping and reshaping sustainability practices.\nWe develop a holistic framework which we use to analyse the governing and mediating roles of accounting-sustainability hybrids in the Environment Agency (of England and Wales) and West Sussex County Council. Our analysis identifies that local accounting-sustainability hybrids contribute positively to improving eco-efficiency, have some impact on eco-effectiveness, but limited bearing on social justice. Emerging assemblages of accounting-sustainability hybrids create capacity for wider sustainability transformations, particularly through their mediating roles. However, a number of factors combine to frustrate further sustainability transformations within these organisations and those they are charged with governing. These factors include the structural constraints of the accounting-sustainability hybrids, influenced by a relatively weak local sustainability programmatic and the pressing need to meet increasing service delivery expectations in a period of severe resource constraints.","title":"Exploring accounting-sustainability hybridisation in the UK public sector","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"576","weight":0.0189,"docData":{"date":"27\/01\/17","money":"488","wordCount":"106","university":"B","abstract":"Several studies have been conducted by environmental psychologists on worker satisfaction from office spaces with the attempt to relate it to human productivity and profit. Most of such studies have been conducted in the western context, those in the cultural context of the Gulf Region being very limited. This research reports on office worker satisfaction from the indoor environment in selected office buildings set in the socio-cultural-religious context of Qatar and the Gulf region. The study used self administered questionnaires as the predominant method for the research. Personal interviews were also conducted with willing participants. Results revealed that around half of the respondents were satisfied with the indoor environment of their offices. Presence of a window and access to daylighting are seen to contribute highly towards satisfaction. Most dissatisfaction expressed was less on account of actual physical conditions and related more to the poor ability of users to control the environmental conditions like temperature, lighting, ventilation and humidity. It is important that building designers provide some means of control over indoor environmental parameters to occupants of workspaces to improve perceived satisfaction and increase worker productivity.","title":"Employee satisfaction from indoor work environments in Doha, Qatar","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"495","weight":0.0172,"docData":{"date":"30\/10\/16","money":"423","wordCount":"175","university":"A","abstract":"The disuse-related bone loss that results from immobilisation following injury shares characteristics with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and the aged, with decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) leading to weakening of the bone and increased risk of fracture. The aim of the study was to use the finite element method to: (i) calculate the mechanical response of the tibia under mechanical load and (ii)  estimate the risk of fracture; comparing between two groups, an able bodied (AB) group and spinal cord injury (SCI) patients group suffering from varying degree of bone loss. The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography. Images were used to develop full three-dimensional models of the tibiae in Mimics (Materialise) and exported into Abaqus (Simulia) for calculation of stress distribution and fracture risk in response to specified loading conditions \u2013 compression, bending and torsion. The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population). The ultimate aim would be to reduce fracture occurrence in these vulnerable groups.","title":"Prediction of risk of fracture in the tibia due to altered bone mineral density distribution resulting

Specifically, the effect of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport is explored. The first investigation explores fast electron transport in allotropes of carbon by measuring the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of protons accelerated from the target rear-surface. An analytical model is developed which accounts for the rear-surface fast electron sheath dynamics, ionisation and projection of the resulting beam of protons, and is used (in conjunction with the experimental measurements) to infer annular fast electron beam transport with lamentary structure in 200 um-thick diamond targets. The important role that material lattice structure has in defining electrical resistivity, which in turn defines the fast electron transport properties, is established utilising three-dimensional hybrid pa rticle-in-cell (3D hybrid-PIC) simulations together with an analytical model of the resistive lamentation instability. The second investigation explores fast electron transport in silicon utilising both experimental measurements and 3D hybrid-PIC simulations. Annular fast electron transport is demonstrated and explained by resistively generated magnetic fields. The results indicate the potential to completely transform the beam transport pattern by tailoring the resistivity-temperature profile at temperatures as low as a few eV. Additionally, the sensitivity of annular fast electron beam transport is explored by varying the drive laser pulse parameters (i.e. energy, focal spot radius and pulse duration) and is found to be particularly sensitive to the peak laser pulse intensity. An ability to optically 'tune' the properties of an annular fast electron transport pattern may be important for applications. In the final investigation the effect that initial target temperature, and thus lattice melt, has on fast electron transport properties is demonstrated. Laser-accelerated proton beams are used to isochorically heat silicon for several tens-of-picoseconds prior to the propagation of fast electrons through the pre-heated target. This enables the influence of resistivity gradients, generated by proton-induced lattice melt, on fast electron transport properties to be explored. The experimental observation of an annular proton beam after t heat = 30 ps of proton pre-heating, which corresponds to annular electron transport within the target, is in excellent qualitative agreement with 3-D hybrid-PIC simulations of fast electron transport in a target containing an initial temperature (and thus, resistivity) gradient.","title":"Effects of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport in relativistic laser-solid interactions","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"421","weight":0.8728,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/17","money":"730","wordCount":"55","university":"B","abstract":"Studies of a broad bandwidth, two-colour FEL amplier using one monoenergetic electron beam are presented.

Due to the need for accurate dosimetry of small field size VHEE beams we have performed dose measurements using EBT2 Gafchromic® film. Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response. Neutron and proton contribution to the equivalent doses are negligible for VHEE. The study demonstrates that EBT2 Gafchromic film is a reliable dosimeter that can be used for dosimetry of VHEE.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"192","weight":0.7362,"docData":{"date":"01\/02\/16","money":"764","wordCount":"72","university":"D","abstract":"We present an approach to modelling the effect of the laser focal spot size on the acceleration of protons from ultra-thin foil targets irradiated by ultra-short laser pulses of intensity 10 16 \u201310 18 W cm −2 .

However, the condition for the occurrence of stochastic resonance is conventionally defined by the Kramers rate. This definition is inadequate because of the necessity and difficulty in estimating white noise density. A bistable mechanism has been designed using an explicit analytical model which implies a new approach for achieving stochastic resonance in the paper. Experimental tests confirm that the addition of a small-scale force to the bistable system excited by a random signal apparently leads to a corresponding amplification of the response that we now term square-wave-driven stochastic resonance.

Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry.

The PEF treatment of microalgae, Spirulina, was conducted using 33.3- and 66.7-kV\/cm electric field impulses. The efficiency of the PEF treatment for inactivation of microalgae was assessed by comparison of the growth curves of PEF-treated and untreated samples.

Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.","title":"Quantum trajectories and open many-body quantum systems","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"383","weight":0.0861,"docData":{"date":"22\/03\/18","money":"432","wordCount":"93","university":"C","abstract":"There is wide agreement about the activities that encompass open innovation. However, little attention has been given towards the extent to which firms have strategically adopted open innovation within their organisation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of corporate strategy on this emergent paradigm. This paper therefore analyses two distinct cases of open innovation in practice from the oil and gas industry. Empirical data suggests that it is possible to provide countless examples of observed open innovation activity. However, these are not necessarily a direct cause of strategic intent towards implementing \nopen innovation. Findings also show that if open innovation is to become a professionally managed activity, research needs to be aligned towards strategy of the firm. Open innovation is a change process that requires attention and commitment levels much like Lean and Six Sigma initiatives. This paper provides empirical evidence to show that open innovation should be concerned with the strategic transformation of an organisation through a shift in organisational culture that requires a managed process.","title":"Open innovation management through strategic implementation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"39","weight":0.0834,"docData":{"date":"01\/09\/17","money":"130","wordCount":"72","university":"C","abstract":"Weld cladding is investigated using a nickel alloy clad on a high strength low alloy carbon steel substrate.

Recent study by Yang (2012)  showed that the different mechanisms of vortex generation could lead  to a similar formation process and a universal principle of the optimal vortex formation could exist. \nPresent work is mainly based on a numerical simulation study of disc vortex ring formation.

The model is built with fluid passing by a 30mm diameter and 2mm thickness disc in a large  computational domain. The simulation results are validated with experimental data. By studying the Iso-surface, representative values, i.e. size of both vortex ring and vortex ring core, circulation and kinetic energy during the formation phases of the vortex ring are investigated.

No significant candidate was found. Upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning IMBHBs with total masses between 100 and 450 M-circle dot and mass ratios between 0.25 and 1 were placed by combining this analysis with an analogous search performed on data from the first LIGO-Virgo joint science run (November 2005-October 2007). The most stringent limit was set for systems consisting of two 88 M-circle dot black holes and is equal to 0.12 Mpc(-3) Myr(-1) at the 90% confidence level. This paper also presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of the impact on the search range of IMBHB spin configurations: the visible volume for IMBHBs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population of IMBHBs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum and uniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas an analogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by similar to 20%.","title":"Search for gravitational radiation from intermediate mass black hole binaries in data from the second LIGO-Virgo joint science run","authors":"H"}},{"docId":"318","weight":0.0732,"docData":{"date":"06\/03\/18","money":"508","wordCount":"82","university":"B","abstract":"The Hull Cell was used to investigate the impact of current density j on the morphology and uniformity of zinc electrodeposited from a 2.5 mol dm−3 Zn2+ solution in 1.5 mol dm−3 methanesulfonic acid at 40◦C onto carbon-composite surfaces.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"263","weight":0.0549,"docData":{"date":"12\/03\/18","money":"628","wordCount":"164","university":"D","abstract":"Various plants have the ability to follow the sun with their flowers or leaves during the course of a day via a mechanism known as heliotropism. This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations.

For practical application, a high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental disinfection system (HINS-light EDS) has been developed and tested in hospital isolation rooms. The trial results have demonstrated that this 405 nm light system can provide continuous disinfection of air and exposed surfaces in occupied areas of the hospital, thereby substantially enhancing standard cleaning and infection control procedures.\n\nConclusion: Violet\u2013blue light, particularly 405 nm light, has significant antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens and, although germicidal efficacy is lower than UV light, this limitation is offset by its facility for safe, continuous use in occupied environments.

While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"371","weight":0.0313,"docData":{"date":"04\/06\/16","money":"861","wordCount":"128","university":"C","abstract":"This study examined the validity of current Actical activity energy expenditure (AEE) equations and intensity cut-points in preschoolers using AEE and direct observation as criterion measures.

In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"466","weight":0.025,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/16","money":"441","wordCount":"40","university":"D","abstract":"Sonic properties of spider silks are measured independent of the web using laser vibrometry and ballistic impact providing insights into Nature's design of functionalized high-performance materials.

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect GWs emitted from merging binary black holes (BBH) and recover their parameters with next-generation GW observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.","title":"The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"348","weight":0.023,"docData":{"date":"22\/09\/17","money":"285","wordCount":"131","university":"E","abstract":"witched reluctance motors (SRMs) have been considered as low-cost machines for electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes tetA and tetB in almost all slaughterhouse zones.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for

These reactions proceed through radical intermediates, but understanding the origin of the radicals has been problematic. Electron transfer from a complex formed from potassium tert-butoxide with additives, such as phenanthroline, has been suggested to initiate the radical process. However, our computational results encouraged us to search for alternatives. We report that heterocycle-derived organic electron donors achieve the coupling reactions and these donors can form in situ in the above cases. We show that an electron transfer route can operate either with phenanthrolines as additives or using pyridine as solvent, and we propose new heterocyclic structures for the respective electron donors involved in these cases. In the absence of additives, and with appropriate substrates, the coupling reactions are still successful although more sluggish,, and benzynes are proposed to play crucial roles in the initiation process in these cases.","title":"Organic super-electron-donors: initiators in transition metal-free haloarene-arene coupling","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"127","weight":0.8929,"docData":{"date":"22\/09\/19","money":"106","wordCount":"28","university":"C","abstract":"The  iridium(I)  hydroxide  complex  [Ir(OH)(COD)(IiPr)]  has been shown to be a competent catalyst for the rearrangement of  allylic  alcohols  to  ketones.

By combining X-ray crystallography with ESI-MS and non-deuterium NMR spectroscopic studies, new light is shed on the heterobimetallic constitution of the intriguing organometallic species [(THF)4MgCl 2Zn(tBu)Cl] (1) and [{Mg2Cl3(THF) 6}+{ZntBu3}-] (2), formed through transmetallation of tBuMgCl with n equivalent amounts of ZnCl2 (n = 1 and 3 respectively). Operating by cooperative effects, alkyl-rich hybrid 2 can effectively promote direct Zn-I exchange reactions with aromatic halides in short periods of time at room temperature in THF solution. The structural elucidation of key organometallic intermediates involved in some of these Zn-I exchanges, provides new reactivity insights into how these bimetallic systems operate. Thus, while the reaction of 2 with 3 equivalents of 2-iodoanisole (3b) gives magnesium dizincate [{Mg(THF)6}2+{Zn(o-C 6H4-OMe)3}2\n-] (4) which demonstrates the 3-fold activation of the tBu groups attached to Zn in 2, using 2-iodobenzonitrile (3i), only two tBu groups react with the substrate, affording [(THF)4MgCl(NC-o-C6H4)ZnI(o-C 6H4-CN)(THF)] (7). In 7 Mg and Zn are connected by an aryl bridge, suggesting that the formation of contacted ion-pair hybrids may have a deactivating effect on the outcome of the Zn-I exchange process.

Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4,4\u2032-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, chloronaphthalene and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS.

Here, we report ultrafast UVpump\u2013IRprobe spectroscopy of 1 at three different excitation wavelengths and in a range of solvents, including under the conditions required for H2 production. Combining spectroscopic measurements of the photochemistry and vibrational relaxation dynamics of 1 with ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that, irrespective of experimental conditions, near-instantaneous carbonyl ligand loss is the main photochemical channel.

As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column. Using extracts from the protozoan parasite Leishmania, we compared the numbers of repeatedly detected LC-HRMS features under different LC conditions with putative identification of metabolites not amongst the standards being based on accurate mass (±3ppm). Besides column chemistry, the pH of the mobile phase plays a key role in not only determining the retention mechanisms of solutes but also the output of the LC-HRMS data processing. Fast evaporation of ammonium carbonate produced less ion suppression in ESI source and consequently improved the detectability of the metabolites in low abundance in comparison with other ammonium salts.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"321","weight":0.2091,"docData":{"date":"03\/10\/17","money":"897","wordCount":"110","university":"D","abstract":"Chemical investigation of a sample of propolis originating from North-Western Cameroon led to the isolation of thirteen alk(en)ylphenols (1-13) (inseparable mixture) along with α-amyrin (14), β-amyrin (15), lupeol (16), cycloartenol (17), mangiferonic acid (18), ambonic acid (19), mangiferolic acid (20), ambolic acid (21), isomangiferolic acid (22) and nine alk(en)ylresorcinols (23-31) (inseparable mixture).

In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"242","weight":0.0527,"docData":{"date":"30\/09\/18","money":"371","wordCount":"57","university":"C","abstract":"A diode-pumped, mechanically-flexible organic distributed-feedback laser that is fully encapsulated with ultra-thin glass is reported.

By considering protein dynamics, autophosphorylation events and\/or the sequence specificity of kinases, 13.8% of these phosphosites can be moved to the allowed region of conformation. We also demonstrate that rSASA values can be used to increase the confidence of identification of phosphorylation sites within an ambiguous MS dataset.\nWhile MS is a stand-alone technique for the identification of vast majority of phosphorylation events, identifications within disallowed region of conformation will benefit from techniques that independently probe for phosphorylation and protein dynamics. Our studies also imply that trapping alternate protein conformations may be a viable alternative to the design of inhibitors against mutation prone drug resistance kinases.","title":"Structural interrogation of phosphoproteome identified by mass spectrometry reveals allowed and disallowed regions of phosphoconformation","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"426","weight":0.0081,"docData":{"date":"21\/03\/16","money":"467","wordCount":"248","university":"D","abstract":"Impurity transport is a subject of fundamental importance in plasma physics in general and in tokamak physics in particular. The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on

paper proposes a bio-inspired algorithm to automatically generate optimal multi-gravity assist trajectories.

These applications, and many others, are all defined in the Sun-Earth three-body problem, while little research has been conducted to investigate the potential of solar sailing in the Earth-Moon three-body problem. This paper therefore aims to find solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem, in particular Lagrange-point orbits. By introducing a solar sail acceleration to the Earth-Moon three-body problem, the system becomes non-autonomous and constraints on the orbital period need to be imposed. In this paper, the problem is solved as a two-point boundary value problem together with a continuation approach: starting from a natural Lagrange-point orbit, the solar sail acceleration is gradually increased and the result for the previous sail performance is used as an initial guess for a slightly better sail performance. Three in-plane steering laws are considered for the sail, two where the attitude of the sail is fixed in the synodic reference frame (perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line) and one where the sail always faces the Sun. The results of the paper include novel families of solar sail Lyapunov and Halo orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lagrange points, respectively. These orbits are double-revolution orbits that wind around or are off-set with respect to the natural Lagrange-point orbit. Finally, the effect of an out-of-plane solar sail acceleration component and that of the Sun-sail configuration is investigated, giving rise to additional families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem.","title":"Solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"784","weight":0.7559,"docData":{"date":"10\/01\/19","money":"890","wordCount":"86","university":"E","abstract":"This work deals with the generation of first-guess interplanetary trajectories\nconnecting Libration Point Orbits (LPOs) belonging to different restricted three body problems.

While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"664","weight":0.6697,"docData":{"date":"20\/06\/17","money":"682","wordCount":"112","university":"E","abstract":"Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are of contemporary, since asteroids and comets\nhold the key clues to understanding the origin of the solar system and the formation of the planets, and also have a speculated wealth of material resources.

First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0.

The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon\u2019s surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system. Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics.

Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites.

Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.","title":"Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"36","weight":0.537,"docData":{"date":"24\/07\/15","money":"425","wordCount":"149","university":"A","abstract":"Solar sail propelled missions to a polar orbit of the Sun offer unique science opportunities. Previous proposals have recommended the use of a 2-phase transfer to reach a solar polar orbit, however a 3-phase transfer has since been shown to offer a significant reduction in the transfer time at the expense of higher thermal stresses. The 3-phase transfer involves spiralling in close to the Sun, performing a rapid inclination increase, and spiralling back out to the final target orbit. A general perturbation solution for such a transfer has been defined which offers significant advantages over the numerically optimised solutions currently available. The insights provided by this analytical solution are used here to rapidly generate a holistic understanding of the mission architecture options available and hence how the mission and system design could be traded. A number of potential science missions are identified which could benefit uniquely from the use of such an orbit. These require that a solar latitude of 60° be achieved within 5 years before proceeding to a true polar orbit. A comparison between the use of the 2- and 3-phase transfer options identify that in real terms, the 3-phase transfer will reach a polar orbit approximately 1 year ahead of the 2-phase transfer. In addition, the increased efficiency of the transfer would allow for an increase in the allowable\npayload mass; with up to an extra 33kg payload potential predicted. Further work should allow for the mission and system design to be traded; for example to investigate the implications of increased thermal system mass (due to a reduction in the minimum solar approach distance) against reduced transfer time or sail size.","title":"Scientific mission to a solar polar orbit using solar sail propulsion","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"687","weight":0.5309,"docData":{"date":"10\/09\/16","money":"814","wordCount":"162","university":"A","abstract":"In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of CubeSats to perform research in the realms of microgravity and earth observation.

This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market.

It is found that an operational system could, mostly likely, be deployed from an Ariane 5 ES to a 16-hour orbit, while a proof-of-concept system could be deployed from a Soyuz launch to the\nsame orbit.","title":"Concepts for a geostationary-like polar missions","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"793","weight":0.4667,"docData":{"date":"17\/08\/19","money":"177","wordCount":"15","university":"A","abstract":"One man is on a mission to bring peace to Uganda\u2019s living and its dead by recording the unreported atrocities of its 20-year war.","title":"Mapping mass atrocities","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"369","weight":0.4629,"docData":{"date":"02\/11\/16","money":"440","wordCount":"121","university":"A","abstract":"With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever. This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design\/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.","title":"Rapid model-based inter-disciplinary design of a CubeSat mission","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"8","weight":0.4405,"docData":{"date":"11\/01\/17","money":"194","wordCount":"168","university":"E","abstract":"Many mission scenarios for nanosatellites and CubeSat hardware have already been created that will require autonomous target tracking and rendezvous maneuvers in close proximity to other orbiting objects. While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"512","weight":0.4308,"docData":{"date":"02\/08\/19","money":"463","wordCount":"65","university":"E","abstract":"The dynamics of solar sails with a variable surface reflectivity distribution are investigated.

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment.

The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.","title":"An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"326","weight":0.1471,"docData":{"date":"20\/12\/19","money":"850","wordCount":"68","university":"B","abstract":"We consider resource allocation problems where inputs are allocated to different entities such as activities, projects or departments.

This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing.

this chapter the institution of Parliament is located within the broader ideational frames of parliamentarism and parliamentary democracy in order to examine the contestability of the notion of parliamentary crisis in the UK. Various dimensions of crisis are analysed: a \u2018crisis of public confidence\u2019 in the institution of parliament; a \u2018crisis of parliamentarism\u2019 as a system of government posed by governance theories, and a \u2018crisis of parliamentary representation\u2019 rooted in attitudinal changes and reappraisals of political representation which assert the democratic legitimacy of nonelectoral representation and representative claim making. The concepts of legitimacy and legitimation are threaded through the analysis: as both are central to any understanding of the institutional purpose and standing of parliament, as well as to a conceptualisation of crisis. The argument is advanced that if there is a parliamentary crisis, or a series of interconnected crises, then it might well be that what the UK is witnessing is a conceptual crisis: a crisis that stems from the counter-positioning of established notions of representative democracy and legitimacy derived from electoral processes against countervailing conceptions of governance, democratic representation and representative claims which are not focused upon, or do not privilege, the institutional form of parliament or electoral representation.","title":"A crisis of parliament","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"387","weight":0.8293,"docData":{"date":"22\/07\/16","money":"595","wordCount":"82","university":"C","abstract":"The case of Drury v HM Advocate 2001 SLT 1013 was regarded by academic commentators as potentially disruptive of the relationship between mens rea and defences in Scots criminal law, in relation to murder.  Specifically, there was a concern that proof of the absence of a defence (such as self-defence and provocation) would now be required to establish the mens rea of wicked intention to kill.  Contemporaneous and subsequent cases (Galbraith v HM Advocate 2002 JC 1 (diminished responsibility) and Lord Advocate\u2019s Reference No 1 of 2000 2001 JC 143 (necessity)) were closely scrutinised to see if the trend was borne out in relation to other defences and other crimes.  Though this appeared not to be the case, the issue itself remains worthy of scrutiny.  This chapter examines that issue more generally, from a normative perspective, in relation to necessity, coercion and automatism in Scots law.  It will seek to identify the existing relationship between mens rea and these defences and to consider how this might best operate.","title":"How do they do that?

After drawing out the twin visions of 'progressive' feminist politics that undergird this narrative \u2014 cached out in terms of either the retrieval of past socialist feminist glories or personal reinvention \u2014 we subject to critical scrutiny both the substantive claims made and the conceptual scaffolding invoked. We argue that the proleptic imaginings of all three authors, in different ways, are highly circumscribed in terms of the recommended agent, agenda and practices of progressive politics, and clouded by conceptual muddle over the meanings of 'left', 'radical' and 'progressive'. Taken together, these problems render the conclusions of Fraser, Eisenstein and McRobbie at best unconvincing and at worst dismissive of contemporary feminist efforts to challenge neoliberalism. We end the paper by disentangling and redefining left, radical and progressive and by sketching a contrasting substantive vision of progressive feminist politics enabled by this reconceptualisation.","title":"Reclaiming feminist futures: co-opted and progressive politics in a neoliberal age","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"657","weight":0.8077,"docData":{"date":"18\/06\/19","money":"248","wordCount":"26","university":"B","abstract":"\u201CPast violence is the best predictor of future violence\u201D \u2013 How many times have you encountered or indeed used this statement in your own practice?

The first functions as continuity, in so far as it is claimed that historical colonial dynamics are reproduced in contemporary postcolonial environments, broadly conceived. The second involves translation. This is related to the first but different in that it focuses in particular on the utility of Orientalist critique for the concept of Islamophobia. The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that \u2018the making of Muslims\u2019 is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider \u2018decentring\u2019 of the West. Meer argues that this third framing rests on terrain that is also populated by scholarship beyond the postcolonial tradition. This is because it expresses a story of how Muslims have contested and sought revisions to existing citizenship settlements, not least the ways in which approaches to anti-discrimination are configured. This is a story that is observable within imperfect liberal democratic frameworks that contain some institutional levers through which to challenge Islamophobia.","title":"Islamophobia and postcolonialism: continuity, Orientalism and Muslim consciousness","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"550","weight":0.762,"docData":{"date":"25\/04\/18","money":"438","wordCount":"126","university":"B","abstract":"This article is a case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in the lives of young lesbians in the United Kingdom. Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010). Here, we examine the highly gendered and heteronormative \u201Crole models,\u201D \u201Cmentors,\u201D and (familial) mediations experienced by young lesbian Christians, as intersecting public\u2013private domains in the production of queer religious subjectivity and dis-identification.","title":"Making space for young lesbians in church?

The study draws on artefacts, interviews and videos created by and around Rancid to identify and analyse this example of marginal, alternative entrepreneurship.

Rancid\u2019s entrepreneurial story is depicted as cycles, not just a linear journey, but following more complicated paths \u2013 from periphery to centre, and back again; returning to roots, whilst trying to move forwards too; grounded in tradition but also radically focused on dramatic change.

Viewing place as a symbolic part of the consumption process, a \"Model of Festival Place\" is developed. This advances theories that presuppose environment as nothing more than a context for consumption. Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx\u2019s work on fictitious capital.  Fictitious capital is any form of investment (for example bonds, stocks, derivatives, and collateralized debt obligations) which is based upon the expectation of future returns.  According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value \u2013 only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession\u2019s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.  The intuitional structures of accounting mean that it is susceptible of being captured by the most powerful in society.","title":"Accounting for the fictitious: a Marxist contribution to understanding accounting's roles in the financial crisis","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"168","weight":0.5935,"docData":{"date":"07\/09\/17","money":"369","wordCount":"91","university":"E","abstract":"The trajectory of entrepreneurship scholarship can be characterized by a trend towards functionalist approaches.

Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"394","weight":0.532,"docData":{"date":"25\/10\/18","money":"711","wordCount":"94","university":"E","abstract":"The Afghan people are shrouded in rumor, myth and superstition.

It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services.

The differences we identify hinge on issues of gendered representability and identification which have long been at the heart of feminist film scholarship.","title":"I love you, man: gendered narratives of friendship in contemporary romantic comedies","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"431","weight":0.4932,"docData":{"date":"04\/10\/16","money":"941","wordCount":"73","university":"D","abstract":"This article questions the preconceived notions that participants in virtual worlds are essentially consumers.

It argues that the contracts cannot be regulated with consumer protection legislation, as interests such as property or intellectual property are beyond the scope of consumer protection regimes.

The presentation discusses initial findings from fieldwork conducted in a school in the United Kingdom, which researched young people\u2019s conceptions of political information, how they interact with information sources and how this relates to their sense of political agency. The research sought a\ndeep understanding of the topic and took a phenomenographic approach.

Nonetheless in many jurisdictions take up is low despite positive evidence relating to use and there is scant empirical knowledge about construction lawyers' role in the referral of cases to mediation and sophisticated evidence relative to lawyer and client interaction in the expediting use of the process. This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper.

However, they are rarely used in practice due to over-parameterization concerns, difficulties in ensuring identification and computational challenges. With the growing interest in multivariate time series models of high dimension, these problems with VARMAs become even more acute, accounting for the dominance of VARs in this field. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach for inference in VARMAs which surmounts these problems. It jointly ensures identification and parsimony in the context of an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We use this approach in a macroeconomic application involving up to twelve dependent variables.

How do states choose organizations for cooperation? We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991\u20132011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects. States implement projects in collaboration with the World Bank, which has the most expertise and resources among the GEF\u2019s implementing agencies, if their regime type is democracy, the project size is large, and the benefits are primarily national.

Existing empirical work simply uses the estimates as an explanatory variable and discards the information provided by the standard errors. In this paper, we argue that the appropriate practice should be to take into account the uncertainty around the WGI estimates through the use of multiple imputation. We investigate the importance of our proposed approach by revisiting in three applications the results of recently published studies. These applications cover the impact of governance on (i) capital flows; (ii) international trade; (iii) income levels around the world. We generally find that the estimated effects of governance are highly sensitive to the use of multiple imputation.

We prove that strictly classical bipartite correlations may still require global entanglement and that unentangled---albeit not strictly classical---reductions may require global genuine multipartite entanglement, rather than simple entanglement. On the other hand, for three qubits, the strict classicality of the bipartite reductions rules out the need for genuine multipartite entanglement.

At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"434","weight":0.0898,"docData":{"date":"10\/08\/17","money":"353","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"This article reflects on my 2005 article in this journal, entitled \u2018Models of Continuing Professional Development: a framework for analysis\u2019.

As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation\u2019s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences. This paper focuses on divergent representations of Rwandan monarchical figures \u2013 often unnamed \u2013 whom the narrators imbue with values according to their individual political affiliations, lived experiences, and identity. These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.","title":"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"410","weight":0.0676,"docData":{"date":"26\/02\/16","money":"877","wordCount":"74","university":"C","abstract":"This paper investigates the investment decisions of IPO investors when equipped with information on both the quality of the firm and the market sentiment.

Her informal transatlantic alliance with U.S. President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989 played an important role in the promotion of an international neoliberal policy agenda that remains influential today. Her critique of UK social democracy during the 1970s and her adoption of key neoliberal strategies, such as financial deregulation, trade liberalization, and the privatization of public goods and services, were popularly labeled Thatcherism. In this article, we consider the nature of Thatcherism and its impact on health and well-being during her period as prime minister and, to a lesser extent, in the years that follow; we focus mainly on Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments. In addition, her public-sector reforms applied business principles to the welfare state and prepared the National Health Service for subsequent privatization.","title":"The impact of Thatcherism on health and well-being in Britain","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"647","weight":0.0583,"docData":{"date":"16\/05\/19","money":"449","wordCount":"206","university":"A","abstract":"An ancestral legacy is often viewed as the epitome of heritage tourism (McCain, 2003) and can generate the feelings of personal attachment craved by many tourists (Timothy and Boyd, 2006). Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their \u2018feet on the ground\u2019 where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for \u2018generation bagging\u2019  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.  We contribute to heritage tourism studies by revealing how extensive and well preserved archives, local knowledge and a passion for family history can serve to generate unique and deeply emotional tourism experiences for ancestral tourists.

This resistance was carried further by the Scottish Covenanters fighting and winning the Bishops\u2019 Wars in 1639-40 and then exporting their revolution through armed intervention in Ireland from 1642 and in England from 1644. The Scottish Covenanters\u2019 alliance with the English Parliamentarians was formalised by the Solemn League and Covenant which again sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy throughout the three Stuart kingdoms. But these events cannot be viewed solely as British and Irish Civil Wars. They must be contextualised in relation to the Thirty Years War and particularly to the determination of France under both Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin to supplant the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs as the foremost European power. While much work has recently been done on the diplomatic links of the principal protagonists in the Civil Wars, the importance of France to Scottish Covenanters, English Parliamentarians and Irish Confederates in their tangled and tortuous relationships among themselves and with Charles I remains relatively underworked.

It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned. The myth of construction supply chain management and by extension best practice in UK construction continues unabated albeit under a shiny new banner, Construction 2025.","title":"The myth of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"604","weight":0.0477,"docData":{"date":"18\/02\/17","money":"843","wordCount":"168","university":"E","abstract":"Primary physical education (PPE) is increasingly being recognised for the role it can potentially play in setting a foundation for lifelong engagement in physical activity. However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"452","weight":0.045,"docData":{"date":"15\/10\/18","money":"906","wordCount":"89","university":"E","abstract":"Non-thermal plasma can produce reactive species such as O, O3 and OH toinduce dye degradation in water.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"130","weight":0.04,"docData":{"date":"29\/12\/15","money":"632","wordCount":"75","university":"B","abstract":"WithScotland and CELCIS (Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland), supported by Police Scotland and Social Work Scotland, hosted a conference on Child Sexual Exploitation on Thursday 6th November 2014.

The model then calculates and compares wind farm reliability due to corrective maintenance and component failure rates influenced by the wind speed of each of the sites. Results show that the components affected most by changes in average daily wind speed are the control system and the yaw system. A comparison between this model and a more simple estimation of site yield is undertaken. The model takes into account the effects of the wind speed on the cost of operation and maintenance and also includes the impact of longer periods of downtime in the winter months and shorter periods in the summer.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"334","weight":0.0254,"docData":{"date":"16\/03\/15","money":"298","wordCount":"79","university":"E","abstract":"Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), constitutes the demands that teachers are supposed to meet.

But like many attempts to reform mathematical curricula elsewhere, CfE does not address the fundamental issue of mathematical understanding. Of course, learner understanding transcends the mathematical curriculum per se, but the significance of mathematical understanding for competent functioning exemplifies the imperative of teaching for understanding or 'deep learning'. The essay begins with some conceptual 'ground clearing' to establish mathematical understanding as a neglected issue.

To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed. The results of a simulation made in QForm are analyzed and compared with some initial experimental data.","title":"FEM Simulation of microstructure refinement during severe deformation","authors":"H &

in a 3-D structure called hypercube, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) suffers from large volume of data and high computational cost for data analysis. To overcome such drawbacks, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, a severe bottleneck is how to compute the PCA covariance matrix efficiently and avoid computational difficulties, especially when the spatial dimension of the hypercube is large. In this paper, structured covariance PCA (SC-PCA) is proposed for fast computation of the covariance matrix. In line with how spectral data is acquired in either the push-broom or tunable filter way, different implementation schemes of SC-PCA are presented. As the proposed SC-PCA can determine the covariance matrix from partial covariance matrices in parallel even without deducting the mean vector in prior, it facilitates real-time data analysis whilst the hypercube is acquired. This has significantly reduced the scale of required memory and also allows efficient onsite feature extraction and data reduction to benefit subsequent tasks in coding\/compression, transmission, and analytics of hyperspectral data.","title":"Structured covariance principal component analysis for real-time onsite feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"404","weight":1.0,"docData":{"date":"31\/12\/19","money":"117","wordCount":"37","university":"E","abstract":"In this paper a novel feature extraction technique for micro-Doppler classification and its real time implementation using SVM on an embedded low-cost DSP are presented.

Consequently, coding and compression is needed for effective data reduction whilst maintaining the image integrity. In this paper, a multivariate vector quantization (MVQ) approach is proposed for the compression of HSI, where the pixel spectra is considered as a linear combination of two codewords from the codebook, and the indexed maps and their corresponding coefficients are separately coded and compressed. A strategy is proposed for effective codebook design, using the fuzzy C-mean (FCM) to determine the optimal number of clusters of data and selected codewords for the codebook. Comprehensive experiments on several real datasets are used for performance assessment, including quantitative evaluations to measure the degree of data reduction and the distortion of reconstructed images.

Composite laminate structures generally demonstrate nonlinear dynamic behaviour as a result of their intrinsic material nonlinear nature.

To approach this problem this work investigates the effect of some key signal and transformation parameters, such as signal length and sampling frequency as well as the SSA window length on the performance of the methodology itself. The selection of these parameters has a direct influence on the damage sensitivity and the accuracy of the methodology. The variation of these parameters can produce radical changes on the clustering effect of the methodology and it is demonstrated that this might affect the results interpretation.","title":"Singular spectrum analysis  for identifying structural nonlinearity using free-decay responses: Application detection and diagnosis in composite laminates","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"193","weight":0.9783,"docData":{"date":"24\/03\/16","money":"611","wordCount":"92","university":"A","abstract":"This paper investigates the usefulness of switching Gaussian state space models as a tool for implementing dynamic model selection (DMS) or averaging (DMA) in time-varying parameter regression models.

It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves.

But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.","title":"A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"698","weight":0.6495,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/16","money":"632","wordCount":"97","university":"B","abstract":"This document describes the development of a full scale empirical validation dataset for building energy simulation tools.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"572","weight":0.6,"docData":{"date":"11\/09\/18","money":"216","wordCount":"125","university":"D","abstract":"Graph-based signal processing (GSP) is an emerging field that is based on representing a dataset using a discrete signal indexed by a graph. Inspired by the recent success of GSP in image processing and signal filtering, in this paper, we demonstrate how GSP can be applied to non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM) due to smoothness of appliance load signatures. NALM refers to disaggregating total energy consumption in the house down to individual appliances used. At low sampling rates, in the order of minutes, NALM is a difficult problem, due to significant random noise, unknown base load, many household appliances that have similar power signatures, and the fact that most domestic appliances (for example, microwave, toaster), have usual operation of just over a minute. In this paper, we proposed a different NALM approach to more traditional approaches, by representing the dataset of active power signatures using a graph signal. We develop a regularization on graph approach where by maximizing smoothness of the underlying graph signal, we are able to perform disaggregation. Simulation results using publicly available REDD dataset demonstrate potential of the GSP for energy disaggregation and competitive performance with respect to more complex Hidden Markov Model-based approaches.","title":"A graph-based signal processing approach for low-rate energy disaggregation","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"238","weight":0.6,"docData":{"date":"05\/06\/16","money":"574","wordCount":"75","university":"B","abstract":"Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) models have many theoretical properties which should make them popular among empirical macroeconomists.

The relationship between the metastable limit and cooling rate is of particular interest, as it can be utilized to derive nucleation kinetic parameters. However, this relationship is open to interpretation. This work presents the application of three such interpretations (Nývlt, Kubota and a population balance based method) to a cooling crystallization of adipic acid in an oscillatory baffled crystallizer, a relatively new type of crystallizer with increased studies and applications in continuous plug flow operation. It also considers the role the device employed to detect nucleation events plays in the derived kinetic parameters. The result of this study shows that although all three interpretations can reasonably predict the maximum sub-cooling over a tested range of cooling rates, the linear assumptions in the Nývlt and Kubota interpretations give increased deviations from the experimental data, in particular for faster cooling rates. In contrast to the two aforementioned models, the population balance based method maintains a minimal deviation across the whole range of cooling rates used. In addition, although the population balance method does not consider the sensitivity of detection tools in its implementation, while the Kubota method does, the sensitivity of nucleation detection is reflected in the derived nucleation rate constants.

The motivating hypothesis was that such stochastic resonance can be efficiently realized in a bistable mechanism. However, the condition for the occurrence of stochastic resonance is conventionally defined by the Kramers rate. This definition is inadequate because of the necessity and difficulty in estimating white noise density. A bistable mechanism has been designed using an explicit analytical model which implies a new approach for achieving stochastic resonance in the paper. Experimental tests confirm that the addition of a small-scale force to the bistable system excited by a random signal apparently leads to a corresponding amplification of the response that we now term square-wave-driven stochastic resonance. The study therefore indicates that this approach may be a promising way to improve the performance of an energy harvester under certain forms of random excitation.","title":"On square-wave-driven stochastic resonance for energy harvesting in a bistable system","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"133","weight":0.5734,"docData":{"date":"25\/04\/18","money":"255","wordCount":"75","university":"A","abstract":"This paper presents an investigation into the properties of a stochastic process whereby the value of a fund grows arithmetically and decays geometrically over discrete time periods.

Further investigation was performed by running the samples to breakdown. The results show that even in the presence of harmonics, an increase of PD occurrence and phase distribution translates into the expected PSA pattern, where clusters of data points merge to form a 45° straight line.

Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness.

While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods.

The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data.

This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design\/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.","title":"Rapid model-based inter-disciplinary design of a CubeSat mission","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"540","weight":0.5117,"docData":{"date":"27\/11\/19","money":"830","wordCount":"43","university":"A","abstract":"Our goal is to relax a sufficient condition for the exponential almost sure stability\nof a certain class of stochastic differential equations.

We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.","title":"Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"33","weight":0.4877,"docData":{"date":"17\/02\/16","money":"123","wordCount":"121","university":"A","abstract":"In this paper, the well known stagewise additive modeling using a multiclass exponential (SAMME) boosting algorithm is extended to address problems where there exists a natural order in the targets using a cost-sensitive approach.

If each wind turbine in a wind farm is forecasted individually, this considerably increases the computational cost, especially for a large wind farm. In this work, a compromise approach is developed where the turbines in the wind farm are clustered and a forecast made for each cluster. Three clustering methods are evaluated: K-means; a self-organizing map (SOM); and spectral clustering (SC). At first, wind turbines in a wind farm are clustered into several groups by identifying similar characteristics of wind speed and output power. Sihouette coefficient and Hopkins statistics indices are adopted to determine the optimal cluster number which is an important parameter in cluster analysis. Next, forecasting models of the selected representative wind turbines for each cluster based on correlation analysis are established separately. A comparative study of the forecast effect is carried to determine the most effective clustering method. Results show that the short-term wind power forecasting on the basis of SOM and SC clustering are effective to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm with better accuracy, respectively, 1.67% and 1.43% than the forecasts using a single wind speed or power to represent the wind farm. Both Hopkins statistics and Sihouette coefficient are effective in choosing the optimal number of clusters. In addition, SOM with its higher forecast accuracy and SC with more efficient calculation when applied into wind power forecasts can provide guidance for the operating and dispatching of wind power.

To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed.

Previous proposals have recommended the use of a 2-phase transfer to reach a solar polar orbit, however a 3-phase transfer has since been shown to offer a significant reduction in the transfer time at the expense of higher thermal stresses. The 3-phase transfer involves spiralling in close to the Sun, performing a rapid inclination increase, and spiralling back out to the final target orbit. A general perturbation solution for such a transfer has been defined which offers significant advantages over the numerically optimised solutions currently available. The insights provided by this analytical solution are used here to rapidly generate a holistic understanding of the mission architecture options available and hence how the mission and system design could be traded. A number of potential science missions are identified which could benefit uniquely from the use of such an orbit. These require that a solar latitude of 60° be achieved within 5 years before proceeding to a true polar orbit. A comparison between the use of the 2- and 3-phase transfer options identify that in real terms, the 3-phase transfer will reach a polar orbit approximately 1 year ahead of the 2-phase transfer. In addition, the increased efficiency of the transfer would allow for an increase in the allowable\npayload mass; with up to an extra 33kg payload potential predicted. Further work should allow for the mission and system design to be traded; for example to investigate the implications of increased thermal system mass (due to a reduction in the minimum solar approach distance) against reduced transfer time or sail size.","title":"Scientific mission to a solar polar orbit using solar sail propulsion","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"220","weight":0.4625,"docData":{"date":"09\/01\/19","money":"820","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Abstract Alkene metathesis has grown from a niche technique to a common component of the synthetic organic chemistry toolbox, driven in part by the development of more active catalyst systems, or those optimized for particular purposes.

Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased.

The first heuristic algorithm arranges new tasks by inserting or deleting them, then inserting them repeatedly according to the priority from low to high, which is named IDI algorithm. The second one called ISDR adopts four steps: insert directly, insert by shifting, insert by deleting, and reinsert the tasks deleted. Moreover, two heuristic factors, congestion degree of a time window and the overlapping degree of a task, are employed to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance. Finally, a case is given to test the algorithms.

Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al. (2000) model had good test-retest reliability. Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact. These motor control changes in performance when fatigued were evident in successful putts indicating that even when these elite golfers were able to achieve the goal of holing the putt, moderate levels of fatigue were influencing the consistency of their performance. Theoretical implications for the Craig et al. (2000) model and practical implications for elite golfers are discussed.","title":"Motor control strategies and the effects of fatigue on golf putting performance","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"105","weight":0.4385,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/16","money":"282","wordCount":"130","university":"B","abstract":"The insulating liquids used in industrial applications are typically mineral oils. In recent years however, significant attention has been paid to alternative insulating fluids, including synthetic and natural ester liquids. In order to expand their practical applications, it is important to have detailed information on their dielectric properties. In this present paper, the dielectric properties of synthetic ester, Midel 7131; mineral oil, Shell Diala D; and vegetable (rapeseed) oil have been investigated. It has been shown that Midel 7131 has a higher ac breakdown voltage (27.6 kV) as compared with Diala D oil (26.4 kV) and rapeseed oil (24.6 kV). However, the breakdown voltage of the Diala D oil has the smallest standard deviation (7%) amongst the tested liquids (13% for Midel 7131 and 11% for rapeseed oil). Statistical analysis of the breakdown voltages has been conducted and it has been shown that the ac breakdown voltages can be described by a normal distribution. dc I-V characteristics have been measured and the space charge saturation regime has been observed for all three liquids starting from ~9 kV for positive energisation and ~10 kV for negative energisation in the point-plane topology. Apparent mobilities of the charge carriers in the tested liquids have been obtained using I1\/2-V curves; these mobilities can be used for calculation of the space charge influenced distribution of the electric field in liquid insulators stressed with dc voltage.

Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.","title":"Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"7","weight":0.4338,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/19","money":"239","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy has been proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the structure, dynamics and reactivity of electronically-excited states of inorganic molecules.

This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory.

The prebuckling and buckling analysis, performed on a representative section of a blade stiffened VAT panel, are based on a generalised Rayleigh\u2013Ritz procedure. The buckling analysis includes a first order shear deformation theory by introducing additional shape functions for transverse shear and is therefore applicable to structures with thick skins relative to characteristic length. Modelling of the stiffener is achieved with two approaches; idealisation as a beam attached to the skin\u2019s midplane and as a rigidly attached plate. Comparing results with finite element analysis (Abaqus) for selected case studies, local buckling errors for the beam model and plate model were found to be less than 3% and 2% respectively, whilst the beam model error for global buckling was between 3% and 10%. The analytical model provides an accurate alternative to the computationally expensive finite element analysis and is therefore suitable for future work on the design and optimisation of stiffened VAT panels.","title":"Buckling analysis of stiffened variable angle tow panels","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"93","weight":0.43,"docData":{"date":"07\/04\/15","money":"576","wordCount":"100","university":"A","abstract":"Recent years have seen a rapid growth in demand for ultra high speed data transmission with end users expecting fast, high bandwidth network access.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. \nTo address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. \nThe SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper. Compared with the existing process, the new process is significantly streamlined, and permits an IED-independent system configuration tool to carry out the entire configuration process. No proprietary software or communications are needed. It also allows the protection settings to be performed at a system level, rather than individually on a \u201Cper device\u201D basis. \nThe key challenges that must be addressed in order for the proposed process to be widely adopted are: the IEC 61850 data model for protection settings is not complete; vendors may prefer to maintain proprietary formats; the data model should have the capability to be extended for future protection functions. This paper reports the progress towards addressing these challenges.","title":"Improving IEC 61850 interoperability and simplifying IED configuration through the standardisation of protection settings","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"466","weight":0.425,"docData":{"date":"19\/10\/16","money":"441","wordCount":"40","university":"D","abstract":"Sonic properties of spider silks are measured independent of the web using laser vibrometry and ballistic impact providing insights into Nature's design of functionalized high-performance materials.

The method introduced is based on the identification of a manoeuvre maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach.

The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations.

Rhythm metrics based on segmental durations originally designed for crosslinguistic research have the potential to provide such information. However, these measures may be associated with problems that impact on their clinical usefulness. This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech.

This paper firstly defines three fault categories in terms of fault levels, which lead to different terminal characteristics of the PV modules. The investigation of three faults is also conducted analytically and experimentally and maintenance suggestions are also provided for different fault types. The proposed methodology is developed to combine the electrical and thermal characteristics of PV cells subjected to different fault mechanisms through simulation and experimental tests. Furthermore, the fault diagnosis method can be incorporated into the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes to shift the operating point of the PV string.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing genes encoding the transcription factor (YAP1) and the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (MCR1), either alone or in combination, in an already robust and xylose-consuming industrial strain of S. cerevisiae and evaluated the effect during the fermentation of undiluted and undetoxified spruce hydrolysate. Overexpression of either gene resulted in faster hexose catabolism, but no cumulative effect was observed with the simultaneous overexpression. The improved phenotype of MCR1 overexpression appeared to be related, at least in part, to a faster furaldehyde reduction capacity, indicating that this reductase may have a wider substrate range than previously reported.

The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon\u2019s surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous.

Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing\/take-off pathways to and from Phobos\u2019 surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.","title":"Dynamical systems techniques for designing libration point orbits in proximity of highly-inhomogeneous planetary satellites: Application to the Mars-Phobos elliptic three-body problem with additional gravity harmonics","authors":"H"}},{"docId":"721","weight":0.381,"docData":{"date":"14\/07\/16","money":"962","wordCount":"63","university":"D","abstract":"A means of manipulating the power output of an individual wind turbine has been developed at the University of Strathclyde.

Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1.5-1.8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20-60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate)-type crystallographic structure. The presented results have clear and hitherto unrecognized implications for the mobility of U(VI) in cementitious environments, in particular those associated with the geological disposal of nuclear waste.

The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls.

The proposed methodology is implemented into our in-house, open source, finite element software, which is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental measurements and other numerical results. Finally, the numerical procedure is utilised to simulate primitive octopus arm manoeuvres, such as bending and reaching.","title":"A nonlinear dynamic finite element approach for simulating muscular hydrostats","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"313","weight":0.3732,"docData":{"date":"05\/09\/17","money":"582","wordCount":"67","university":"A","abstract":"The reliability of a novel, all-optical differential current protection scheme over varying environmental conditions is investigated in this paper.

The model is based on Kynch theory (Kynch, 1952), i.e. it describes systems with solids fractions sufficiently low that the solids have not gelled into a weight-bearing network. However the model incorporates a modification to describe how raking the suspension causes flocs or aggregates within it to densify. This floc densification opens up channels between the flocs through which liquid escapes, making the suspension easier to dewater. The densification theory presented here predicts profiles of varying solids fraction vs height in the settling zone in a thickener, information which is not normally available when designing thickeners via the conventional Kynch theory. Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux. As underflow solids fraction is increased, thickeners operated at a specified aggregate densification rate (or equivalently at a fixed settling zone height) tend to approach a 'fully densified' suspension state (defined as a point at which the extent of aggregate densification ceases to change with time), with improved thickening performance.","title":"Effects of aggregate densification upon thickening of Kynchian suspensions","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"787","weight":0.3685,"docData":{"date":"11\/07\/19","money":"943","wordCount":"152","university":"C","abstract":"In this paper a continuous attitude tracking control law is derived directly on the rotation group SO(3). The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.","title":"An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"311","weight":0.3685,"docData":{"date":"29\/05\/18","money":"701","wordCount":"152","university":"D","abstract":"An evidence-led scientific case for development of a space-based polar remote sensing platform at geostationary-like (GEO-like) altitudes is developed through methods including a data user survey. Whilst a GEO platform provides a near static perspective, multiple platforms are required to provide circumferential coverage. Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous. Users also find the placement of apogee over the pole to be preferable to the alternative scenarios. Thus, a clear majority of data users find the \u201CTaranis\u201D orbit concept to be better than a critical inclination orbit, due to the improved perspective offered. The geophysical products that would benefit from a GEO-like polar platform are mainly estimated from radiances in the visible\/near infrared and thermal parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is consistent with currently proven technologies from GEO. Based on the survey results, needs analysis, and current technology proven from GEO, scientific and observation requirements are developed along with two instrument concepts with eight and four channels, based on Flexible Combined Imager heritage.

Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced.

Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area.

First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0. This strategy is suitable to describe the binary characteristic of the MRP, where 1 stands for a node being selected to construct the multicast tree, whereas 0 stands for being otherwise. Second, BVDPSO updates the velocity and position according to the learning mechanism of the original PSO in the continuous domain.

The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding, whose spatial structure is often characterised by a spatially smooth evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units while other pairs exhibit large step changes. This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify step changes is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy. Results from the England study show that the two diseases have similar spatial patterns in risk, and exhibit a number of common step changes in the unmeasured component of risk between neighbouring local authorities.","title":"An adaptive spatio-temporal smoothing model for estimating trends and step changes in disease risk","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"28","weight":0.336,"docData":{"date":"07\/05\/16","money":"649","wordCount":"125","university":"E","abstract":"A Smart Rotor wind turbine is able to reduce fatigue loads by deploying active aerodynamic devices along the span of the blades, which can lead to a reduced cost of energy. However, a major drawback is the complexity and potential for unreliability of the system. Faults can cause catastrophic damage and without compensation would require shutdown of the turbine, resulting in lost revenue. This is the first study to look at a fault ride-through solution to avoid shutdown of the turbine and lost revenue during a fault, while keeping additional damage to a minimum. A worst case scenario of a jammed flap with no direct knowledge of its occurrence is considered, while operating a DQ-axis Smart Rotor wind turbine. A method for detecting the fault using 1P cyclic loadings is presented, as well as two fault ride-through options: setting the remaining active flap angles to zero and setting the remaining flap angles to that of the jammed flap if known. These are analysed using IEC standard load cases. It is found that rapid detection of faults is vital for Smart Rotor controllers to avoid highly damaging cyclic loads caused by rotor imbalance, but that fault ride-through is fairly simple to implement and this allows the load benefits of the Smart Rotor to be accessible even with long fault periods.","title":"Fault ride-through for a smart rotor DQ-axis controlled wind turbine with a jammed trailing edge flap","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"734","weight":0.3334,"docData":{"date":"27\/07\/15","money":"169","wordCount":"54","university":"E","abstract":"We present a paradigm for capturing the complementarity of two observables.

Previous work demonstrated this process to be highly effective across a wide range of contaminants and soil conditions at the bench scale. In this work, a suite of 12 experiments explored the effectiveness of the process as operating scale was increased 1000-fold from the bench (0.003 m3 ) to intermediate (0.3 m3 ) and pilot field-scale (3 m3 ) with coal tar and petrochemical NAPLs. As scale increased, remediation efficiency of 97\u201399.95% was maintained. Smoul- dering propagation velocities of 0.6\u201314 × 10−5 m\/s at Darcy air fluxes of 1.54\u20139.15 cm\/s were consistent with observations in previous bench studies, as was the dependence on air flux. The pilot field-scale experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000mg\/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with increasing scale. Once the threshold was exceeded, basic process characteristics of average peak temperature, destructive efficiency, and treatment velocity were relatively independent of scale.","title":"Volumetric scale-up of smouldering remediation of contaminated materials","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"161","weight":0.3334,"docData":{"date":"08\/03\/18","money":"416","wordCount":"123","university":"D","abstract":"Abstract In the last decade, the EU has driven forward the development and connection of renewable power sources across Europe. This has changed the way in which distribution networks operate, moving from a passive system, to a more active system where generation and demand are located closer together with system states being more complex and variable. Increased penetration of renewable generation into distribution networks is presenting a number of challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) including the provision of network access in capacity constrained networks. The introduction of Active Network Management (ANM) is enabling an increase in renewable generation connections through enhanced network access in otherwise \u2018full\u2019 networks.

In this paper, a comprehensive literature review, detailed case study evaluation on early ANM schemes, quantitative curtailment assessment for different PoA and a qualitative analysis of business models for different ANM PoA is presented in turn with conclusions drawn from these three approaches.","title":"A review and analysis of renewable energy curtailment schemes and Principles of Access: transitioning towards business as usual","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"158","weight":0.3311,"docData":{"date":"17\/08\/19","money":"870","wordCount":"145","university":"D","abstract":"The management of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and of the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) region as a whole is a subject that cannot be deferred, due to the growing exploitation and launch rate in that orbital regime. The advent of the European Galileo and the Chinese Beidou constellations significantly added complexity to the system and calls for an adequate global view on the four constellations present in operation. The operation procedures, including maintenance and disposal practices, of the constellations currently deployed were analyzed in order to asses a proper reference simulation scenario. The complex dynamics of the MEO region with all the geopotential and lunisolar resonances was studied to better identify the proper end-of-life orbit for every proposed strategy, taking into account and, whenever possible, exploiting the orbital dynamics in this peculiar region of space. The possibility to exploit low thrust propulsion or non gravitational perturbations with passive de-orbiting devices (and a combination of the two) was analyzed, in view of possible applications in the design of the future generations of the constellations satellites. Several upgrades in the long-term evolution software SDM and DAMAGE were undertaken to properly handle the constellation simulations in every aspect from constellation maintenance to orbital dynamics.  A thorough approach considering the fulltime evolving covariance matrix associated with every object was implemented in SDM to compute the collision risk and associated maneuver rate for the constellation satellites.

However, no systematic investigation has been carried out with regard to the optimisation of mobile phase characteristics. In this study using 223 metabolite standards, we explored the retention mechanisms on three zwitterionic columns with varied mobile phase composition, demonstrated the interference from poor chromatographic peak shapes on the output of data extraction, and assessed the quality of chromatographic signals and the separation of isomers under each LC condition. As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column. Using extracts from the protozoan parasite Leishmania, we compared the numbers of repeatedly detected LC-HRMS features under different LC conditions with putative identification of metabolites not amongst the standards being based on accurate mass (±3ppm). Besides column chemistry, the pH of the mobile phase plays a key role in not only determining the retention mechanisms of solutes but also the output of the LC-HRMS data processing. Fast evaporation of ammonium carbonate produced less ion suppression in ESI source and consequently improved the detectability of the metabolites in low abundance in comparison with other ammonium salts. Our results show that the combination of a ZIC-pHILIC column with an ammonium carbonate mobile phase, pH 9.2, at 20mM in the aqueous phase or 10mM in both aqueous and organic mobile phase components, provided the most suitable LC conditions for LC-HRMS-based untargeted metabolite profiling of Leishmania parasite extracts.

Due to the large amount of data generated, statistical methods were used to facilitate and improve the results of the analysis. The results revealed a rank of factors influencing mixing efficiency: Reynolds number > number of rhombi > contraction width > inter-obstacles distance. The pressure drop measured after three rhombi depends mainly on Re and inter-obstacle distance. The resulting optimum geometry for the low Re regime has a contraction width of 101 μm and inter-obstacles distance of 93 μm, while for the high Re regime a contraction width of 400 μm and inter-obstacle distance of 121 μm are more appropriate.

The results of this study are presented in a simple \u2018decision tree\u2019 diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, chloronaphthalene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4,4\u2032-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol. Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4,4\u2032-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, chloronaphthalene and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS. Dichlorvos, HCH, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin were also trapped onto Tenax TA™ and qualitatively detected by TD-GC-MS.

Permeation through MN-treated skin was affected by physicochemical characteristics of NPs and the encapsulated dyes. Dye flux was enhanced by smaller particle size, hydrophilicity, and negative zeta potential of NPs. Regarding encapsulated dyes, solubility at physiological pH and potential interaction with skin proteins proved to outweigh molecular weight as determinants of skin permeation. Data were verified using confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging. Findings coupled with the literature data are supportive of a mechanism involving influx of NPs, particularly of smaller size, deep into MN-created channels, generating depot dye-rich reservoirs. Molecular diffusion of the released dye across viable skin layers proceeds at a rate determined by its molecular characteristics.

Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.\nMaterial and Methods\nTwo embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.\nResults\nStatistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p\u200A=\u200A<0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC\u200A=\u200A0.851). Sensitivity and specificity for tissue identification was 77% and 70% respectively to a resolution of 6 mm2.\nConclusions\nThis cadaveric study has evaluated the ability of our elasticity assessment device to differentiate bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter to a resolution of 6 mm2. The results provide useful data for which to continue to examine the use of elasticity assessment devices for tissue quality assessment with the aim of giving haptic feedback to surgeons performing complex surgery.","title":"Tissue quality assessment using a novel direct elasticity assessment device (the e-finger): a cadaveric study of prostatectomy dissection","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"795","weight":0.3125,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/18","money":"594","wordCount":"48","university":"A","abstract":"We investigate transverse symmetry-breaking instabilities emerging from the optomechanical coupling between light and the translational degrees of freedom of a collisionless, damping-free gas of cold, two-level atoms.

Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp.

When compared to onshore wind, O&M costs are increased, due to the use of specialised vessels, shorter weather windows and challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of offshore wind industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus of this paper is to provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the offshore wind farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations. The developed methodology and analysis enable operators to decide the specification of CTVs which will bring the optimum financial benefit, considering both the enhancement of the offshore wind farm power generation as well as the minimisation of the total O&M cost.","title":"Optimum CTV fleet selection for offshore wind farm O&M activities","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"345","weight":0.3087,"docData":{"date":"08\/05\/15","money":"824","wordCount":"81","university":"D","abstract":"Network coding (NC), which combines packets into linear combinations, has been shown to increase the capacity of a network, allocate resources more efficiently, reduce transmission power, and improve transmission reliability.

In this article, we argue that exclusive use of aggregate indices can limit state politics research.

We evaluate the internal consistency of professionalism components over time, the relationship between components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling. We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating multidimensional measures. Scholars should take care to choose the appropriate measure of the concept that best fits the causal relationships under examination.","title":"Should we measure professionalism with an index?

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"614","weight":0.299,"docData":{"date":"18\/10\/18","money":"215","wordCount":"97","university":"B","abstract":"We report a detailed study on size-dependent capacitance, especially the negative capacitance (NC), in InGaN-based micro-pixelated light-emitting diodes (μLEDs).

Analysis of the 2012-2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56.5% experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31.6% (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19.3% for the postal respondents and a much higher 36.6% for the online respondents.

However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like\/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.","title":"Highly anisotropic metasurface: a polarized beam splitter and hologram","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"736","weight":0.2937,"docData":{"date":"16\/04\/16","money":"390","wordCount":"126","university":"B","abstract":"State-of-the-art scenario exercises in the energy and environment fields argue for combining qualitative storylines with quantitative modelling. This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply\u2013demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key.","title":"Linking a storyline with multiple models: a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"289","weight":0.2927,"docData":{"date":"21\/07\/15","money":"671","wordCount":"123","university":"C","abstract":"Torrefied biomass is a coal-like fuel that can be burned in biomass boilers or co-fired with coal in co-firing furnaces. To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC\/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.","title":"High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"233","weight":0.2922,"docData":{"date":"28\/07\/17","money":"314","wordCount":"89","university":"A","abstract":"The change, over time, in density, longitudinal modulus of elasticity, shear modulus and chemical structure of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) under thermal treatment (110, 120 and 140ºC) was evaluated.

Here a new approach has been developed that utilises surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of the formation of G-quadruplexes.

This resulted in an \"on\/off\" method which was successfully used to qualitatively detect the formation of G-quadruplex using quadruplex-forming sequences such as human telomeric and C-MYC promoter DNAs. The unique SERS spectra of each stabilising ligand offer the potential for use of SERS to study higher order DNA structures.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability.

While most prior\nanalysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties\nof the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time\nof solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit\nsolution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the\nevolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.\nLimits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail\nbecomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.\nFinally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely\npassive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively\nfixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral\ntrajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given\nheliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.","title":"Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"632","weight":0.27,"docData":{"date":"15\/06\/19","money":"920","wordCount":"100","university":"E","abstract":"Previous research indicates that residents\u2019 perceptions of their neighbourhoods can have an adverse influence on their health and wellbeing over and above the influence of structural disadvantage.

The simulation results reveal that high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) in silicon (Si-I to Si-II phase transformation) occurred in all cases; however, its extent and the manner in which it occurred differed significantly between polycrystalline silicon and single crystal silicon, and was the main driver of differences in the nanoindentation deformation behaviour between these two types of silicon.

Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"192","weight":0.2639,"docData":{"date":"01\/02\/16","money":"764","wordCount":"72","university":"D","abstract":"We present an approach to modelling the effect of the laser focal spot size on the acceleration of protons from ultra-thin foil targets irradiated by ultra-short laser pulses of intensity 10 16 \u201310 18 W cm −2 .

Mass spectrometry measurements were made at selected ion masses, and classical least squares multivariate linear regression was used to produce concentration profiles for the reactants, products and catalyst.

In validation experiments, good agreement was achieved between the concentration of butyl acetate obtained from in-line MIR spectra and off-line GC. In the initial few minutes of the reaction the profiles for butyl acetate derived from on-line direct liquid sampling mass spectrometry (DLSMS) differed from those of in-line MIR spectrometry owing to the 2min transfer time between the reactor and mass spectrometer.

In this study, we used conversation analysis to examine the compassionate self-soothing task of emotion-focused therapy involving two-chair work, with seven clients. The analysis yielded a detailed description of interactional practices and processes involved in the accomplishment of self-soothing, drawing on Goffman\u2019s concept of the participation frame. In this article we show how therapists and clients collaborate to move from the ordinary frame of therapeutic conversation to a self-soothing frame and back again. Furthermore, we show that in this movement between the frames, they make use of a number interactional practices: therapists'  instructions to clients, specific ways of sequencing actions in interaction, explanations and justification of the importance of the self-soothing task, pronouns as a way to distinguish among addressees (e.g., clients versus soothing agents), corrections of clients\u2019 talk, and response tokens (hm mm, yeah, good). These practices are used to help clients accomplish self-soothing in the form of self-praise, disclosing caring, and offering of helpful advice.","title":"Conversation analysis of the two-chair self-soothing task in emotion-focused therapy","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"178","weight":0.2569,"docData":{"date":"09\/11\/19","money":"262","wordCount":"109","university":"D","abstract":"We study the quantumness of correlations for ensembles of bi- and multi-partite systems and relate it to the task of quantum data hiding. Quantumness is here intended in the sense of minimum average disturbance under local measurements. We consider a very general framework, but focus on local complete von Neumann measurements as cause of the disturbance, and, later on, on the trace-distance as quantifier of the disturbance.  We discuss connections with entanglement and previously defined notions of quantumness of correlations. We prove that a large class of quantifiers of the quantumness of correlations are entanglement monotones for pure bipartite states. In particular, we define an entanglement of disturbance for pure states, for which we give an analytical expression. Such a measure coincides with negativity and concurrence for the case of two qubits. We compute general bounds on disturbance for both single states and ensembles, and consider several examples, including the uniform Haar ensemble of pure states, and pairs of qubit states. Finally, we show that the notion of ensemble quantumness of correlations is most relevant in quantum data hiding. Indeed, while it is known that entanglement is not  necessary for a good quantum data hiding scheme, we prove that ensemble quantumness of correlations is.","title":"Quantumness of correlations, quantumness of ensembles and quantum data hiding","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"410","weight":0.2568,"docData":{"date":"26\/02\/16","money":"877","wordCount":"74","university":"C","abstract":"This paper investigates the investment decisions of IPO investors when equipped with information on both the quality of the firm and the market sentiment.

For practical application, a high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental disinfection system (HINS-light EDS) has been developed and tested in hospital isolation rooms.

Until recently, use of hydrogenase subsite systems for light-driven hydrogen production has typically required the involvement of a photosensitizer, but the molecule [(μ-pdt)(μ-H)Fe2(CO)4(dppv)]+, (1; dppv = cis-1,2-C2H2(PPh2)2; pdt = 1,3-propanedithiolate) has been reported to catalyze the evolution of hydrogen gas under sensitizer-free conditions. Establishing the molecular mechanism that leads to photohydrogen production by 1 is thus an important step that may enable further development of this family of molecules as solar fuel platforms. Here, we report ultrafast UVpump\u2013IRprobe spectroscopy of 1 at three different excitation wavelengths and in a range of solvents, including under the conditions required for H2 production. Combining spectroscopic measurements of the photochemistry and vibrational relaxation dynamics of 1 with ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that, irrespective of experimental conditions, near-instantaneous carbonyl ligand loss is the main photochemical channel. No evidence for a long-lived excited electronic state was found. These results provide the first time-resolved data for the photochemistry of 1 and offer an alternative interpretation of the underlying mechanism of light-driven hydrogen generation.","title":"Investigation of the ultrafast dynamics occurring during unsensitized photocatalytic H2 evolution by an [FeFe]-hydrogenase subsite analogue","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"775","weight":0.25,"docData":{"date":"19\/01\/17","money":"165","wordCount":"60","university":"A","abstract":"This paper argues that the natural rate of unemployment hypothesis, in which equilibrium unemployment is determined by \u201Cstructural\u201D variables alone, is wrong: it is both implausible and inconsistent with the evidence.

This paper presents the ASEM (Attitude Stabilization Electromagnetic Module) concept for detumbling debris in a low Earth orbit with the intention of mitigating risk during capture operations. This paper presents a preliminary design of a system whose purpose is to stabilize a target\u2019s attitude, using an external module equipped with magnetorquers. The device, initially carried by the chaser spacecraft, is attached to the body of the target satellite. The magnetorquers are then used to detumble the target so that the chaser spacecraft can perform a safe approach prior to capture. A simplified model is used in the initial design phase to optimize the mass of the system and to size the torque rods and power source. Alternative methods for attaching the ASEM to the target from the chaser spacecraft are discussed. In addition a novel magnetic control law suitable for this application is presented. The feasibility of the concept is tested in simulations using a model based on Envisat (assuming that the ASEM is already attached to the target).

This paper derives the fault-tolerant control logic under both actuator gain fault mode and actuator deviation fault mode. Taking the parameters of the UKube-1 in the simulation model, a comparison between a traditional spacecraft control method and the adaptive fault-tolerant control method in the presence of a fault is undertaken.

A model for the evolution of the resulting foam front known as \u2018pressure-driven growth\u2019 is analysed. An asymptotic solution of this model for long times is derived that shows that foam can propagate indefinitely into the reservoir without gravity override. Moreover, \u2018pressure-driven growth\u2019 is shown to correspond to a special case of the more general \u2018viscous froth\u2019 model. In particular, it is a singular limit of the viscous froth, corresponding to the elimination of a surface tension term, permitting sharp corners and kinks in the predicted shape of the front. Sharp corners tend to develop from concave regions of the front. The principal solution of interest has a convex front, however, so that although this solution itself has no sharp corners (except for some kinks that develop spuriously owing to errors in a numerical scheme), it is found nevertheless to exhibit milder singularities in front curvature, as the long-time asymptotic analytical solution makes clear. Numerical schemes for the evolving front shape which perform robustly (avoiding the development of spurious kinks) are also developed. Generalisations of this solution to geologically heterogeneous reservoirs should exhibit concavities and\/or sharp corner singularities as an inherent part of their evolution: propagation of fronts containing such \u2018inherent\u2019 singularities can be readily incorporated into these numerical schemes.","title":"Analysis of a model for foam improved oil recovery","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"512","weight":0.2462,"docData":{"date":"02\/08\/19","money":"463","wordCount":"65","university":"E","abstract":"The dynamics of solar sails with a variable surface reflectivity distribution are investigated.

As recently as August 2013, Ofcom reported that fixed broadband uptake in Glasgow remained at 50%; this is significantly below the Scottish average of 68% (Ofcom, 2013). As the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 agenda of the United Kingdom government, which places government services online, becomes ever more pervasive this becomes a more pressing issue for the city. That needs to find ways to increase broadband adoption. There is also a need to uncover the deep seated reasons why there has been no improvement in fixed broadband uptake in the last five years in Glasgow. Internet access is lowest amongst the most deprived in society and those with the lowest incomes (SHS, 2012). Analysis based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation highlights that \u2018income deprivation in Glasgow City is greater than in Scotland as a whole\u2019- 21.5% of Glasgow\u2019s population were income deprived in 2012 (Scottish Government, 2012a, p3).\nThis paper focuses on the deprived areas of Glasgow and whether and how the most disadvantaged in the city use the Internet. The analysis draws on data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and from individuals in deprived areas. This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:\n In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?\n Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?\n What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?\nThe attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.\nSince geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to\n2\nhow they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.\nThere are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.\nThis paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.\nThe second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.\nThis paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"170","weight":0.2433,"docData":{"date":"10\/05\/18","money":"476","wordCount":"74","university":"B","abstract":"Oriented collapse of columns, large-scale destruction debris and temporary abandonment of the area deduced from an archaeological excavation provide evidence for a major (intensity IX) earthquake in Patras, Greece.

Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.","title":"Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"786","weight":0.2422,"docData":{"date":"23\/06\/19","money":"897","wordCount":"190","university":"B","abstract":"Research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"759","weight":0.2414,"docData":{"date":"16\/09\/16","money":"341","wordCount":"116","university":"C","abstract":"A study has been conducted to determine whether lithium magnesiates are feasible candidates for the enantioselective deprotonation of 4-alkylcyclohexanones. The commercially available chiral amine (+)-bis[(R)-1-phenylethyl]amine (2-H) was utilised to induce enantioselection. When transformed to its lithium salt and combined with nBu 2Mg, improved enantioselective deprotonation of 4-tert- butylcyclohexanone (with respect to the monometallic lithium amide) at 20°C was observed. In an attempt to optimise the reaction further, different additives were added to the lithium amide. The best performing deprotonations at 0°C were those in which (Me3SiCH2)2Mg (er pro-S 74:26) and (Me3SiCH2)2Mn (er pro-S 72:28) were added, hence the lithium magnesiate \"LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe 3)2\" was used in the remainder of the study. The optimum solvent for the reaction was found to be THF. NMR spectroscopic studies of a D8-THF solution of \"LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe 3)2\" appear to show that this mono-amide bis-alkyl species is in equilibrium with a bis-amide mono-alkyl compound (and a tris-alkyl lithium magnesiate).

Eight males and eight females undertook three identical sessions, separated by 4 to 6 days; the first being a familiarization session. Individuals performed three 6-second sprints against 50% of the maximal resistance to complete two pedal revolutions with a 3-minute rest between trials. Power was determined independently using both MA and FT analyses. Validity: MA recorded significantly higher Pmax than FT (P < .05). Bland-Altman plots showed that there was a systematic bias in the difference between the measures of the two systems. This difference increased as power increased. Repeatability: Intraclass correlation coefficients were on average 0.90 ± 0.05 in males and 0.85 ± 0.08 in females.

This has been enhanced by increased coverage as well as incentives to physicians and hospitals. Hospital pharmacies dispense 80% of medicines in China, with medicines currently accounting for 46% of total hospital expenditure. Hospitals currently rely on revenues from procurement of medicines for their sustainability. Principal measures to moderate growth in drug expenditure include initiatives to reduce procured drug prices. However, to date no formal pricing policies for generics in China similar to Europe and limited demand-side measures to enhance appropriate prescribing, e.g. no universal measures to monitor the quality of prescribing. Current incentives have led to irrationality in prescribing; e.g. high use of injectable drugs, antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) despite the development of essential medicine lists. Objective: Assess current utilisation and expenditure of CV medicines including TCMs between 2006 and 2012 and compare the findings with Western European countries. Methods: Uncontrolled retrospective study of prescriptions to treat cardio-vascular disease in one of the largest hospitals in Southwest China. Results: Utilisation of CV drugs increased 3.3 fold during the study period, greatest for TCMs. Procured expenditure increased 4.85 fold. Variable utilisation of generics at 29% to 31% of the total for each molecule in recent years among high volume pharmacotherapeutic products.  However, low prices for generics have been achieved through multiple supply-side measures, matching those achieved among some European countries. Continued irrationality in prescribing is seen with high use TCMs despite limited evidence and the utilisation of drugs dropping significantly once low prices procured. Conclusion: Prices still have appreciable impact on the subsequent utilization of different CV drugs in China. Consequently, there is appreciable potential to introduce measures similar to Western Europe to improve future rationality and reduce overall drug costs. This could include robust formularies, quality targets and financial incentives. We are beginning to see improved rationality in the use of medicines with a reduction in TCMs. This will be monitored along with other suggestions to further enhance accessibility to medicines in China without prohibitive increases in pharmaceutical and overall expenditure.","title":"Initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China and their influence: cardio-cerebral vascular medicines as a case history to provide future direction","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"617","weight":0.2395,"docData":{"date":"05\/12\/16","money":"510","wordCount":"142","university":"B","abstract":"This paper argues that the \"institutionalised understanding\" of pseudo-code as a blend of formal and natural languages makes it an unsuitable choice for national assessment where the intention is to test program comprehension skills. It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language.

D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels.

A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"34","weight":0.2346,"docData":{"date":"22\/01\/16","money":"693","wordCount":"162","university":"B","abstract":"Solar sailing has been proposed for a range of novel space applications, including hovering above the ecliptic for high-latitude observations of the Earth and monitoring the Sun from a sub-L1 position for space weather forecasting. These applications, and many others, are all defined in the Sun-Earth three-body problem, while little research has been conducted to investigate the potential of solar sailing in the Earth-Moon three-body problem. This paper therefore aims to find solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem, in particular Lagrange-point orbits. By introducing a solar sail acceleration to the Earth-Moon three-body problem, the system becomes non-autonomous and constraints on the orbital period need to be imposed. In this paper, the problem is solved as a two-point boundary value problem together with a continuation approach: starting from a natural Lagrange-point orbit, the solar sail acceleration is gradually increased and the result for the previous sail performance is used as an initial guess for a slightly better sail performance. Three in-plane steering laws are considered for the sail, two where the attitude of the sail is fixed in the synodic reference frame (perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line) and one where the sail always faces the Sun. The results of the paper include novel families of solar sail Lyapunov and Halo orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lagrange points, respectively. These orbits are double-revolution orbits that wind around or are off-set with respect to the natural Lagrange-point orbit. Finally, the effect of an out-of-plane solar sail acceleration component and that of the Sun-sail configuration is investigated, giving rise to additional families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem.","title":"Solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"131","weight":0.2337,"docData":{"date":"08\/06\/19","money":"969","wordCount":"214","university":"C","abstract":"The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave (GW) astrophysics communities.

We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.","title":"Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"490","weight":0.2319,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"853","wordCount":"69","university":"C","abstract":"Passive mode-locking in semiconductor lasers in a Fabry-Perot configuration with a bandgap blueshift applied to the saturable absorber (SA) section has been experimentally characterized.

Continuous control of the fixed comb initial vertical offset is achieved using an electrothermal actuator integrated in the AVC. Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations and experiments of the AVC structure show good agreement, with the initial vertical offset of the fixed comb reducing theoretically from 10.8 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 6.0 μm (500 mW to actuator) and experimentally from 10.4 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 4.9 μm (510 mW to actuator). Experimentally, a change of the initial vertical comb-offset from 10.4 μm to 4.9 μm leads to a reduction of the measured dynamic total optical scan angle (TOSA) from 27° to 19° for 100 V ac actuation. In addition, a mechanically assisted deflection of the AVC actuators to achieve an almost in-plane comb configuration further reduces the measured dynamic TOSA to about 3°. The overall device behavior is modeled using a hybrid simulation approach combining FEM analysis of the AVC capacitance with an analytical solution of the motion equation of the scanner. The analysis show good agreement, with the experimentally measured characteristics; overall showing an increased TOSA with higher initial comb offsets.","title":"Dynamic properties of angular vertical comb-drive scanning micromirrors with electrothermally controlled variable offset","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"671","weight":0.2283,"docData":{"date":"16\/12\/16","money":"196","wordCount":"92","university":"D","abstract":"Ferrihydrite was exposed to U(VI)-containing cement leachate (pH 10.5) and aged to induce crystallization of hematite.

Deriving and solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with fermions.","title":"Light scattering and dissipative dynamics of many fermionic atoms in an optical lattice","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"198","weight":0.2263,"docData":{"date":"07\/03\/16","money":"239","wordCount":"137","university":"D","abstract":"Technetium incorporation into magnetite and its behavior during subsequent oxidation has been investigated at high pH to determine the technetium retention mechanism(s) on formation and oxidative perturbation of magnetite in systems relevant to radioactive waste disposal. Ferrihydrite was exposed to Tc(VII)(aq) containing cement leachates (pH 10.5-13.1), and crystallization of magnetite was induced via addition of Fe(II)aq. A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical extraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques provided direct evidence that Tc(VII) was reduced and incorporated into the magnetite structure. Subsequent air oxidation of the magnetite particles for up to 152 days resulted in only limited remobilization of the incorporated Tc(IV). Analysis of both X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data indicated that the Tc(IV) was predominantly incorporated into the magnetite octahedral site in all systems studied.

We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks.

This paper reviews Scottish energy strategy since 1999 and notes the stronger policy link in recent years between investment in low carbon and renewable energy and related employment growth. The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

Due to the need for accurate dosimetry of small field size VHEE beams we have performed dose measurements using EBT2 Gafchromic® film. Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response. Neutron and proton contribution to the equivalent doses are negligible for VHEE. The study demonstrates that EBT2 Gafchromic film is a reliable dosimeter that can be used for dosimetry of VHEE. The results indicate an energy-independent response of the dosimeter for 20 MeV and 165 MeV electron beams and has been found to be suitable for dosimetry of VHEE.","title":"Dosimetry of very high energy electrons (VHEE) for radiotherapy applications: using radiochromic film measurements and Monte Carlo simulations","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"261","weight":0.2242,"docData":{"date":"17\/02\/15","money":"804","wordCount":"116","university":"B","abstract":"Enhanced cooling via forced convection using cryogenic liquid is an option for controlling grain growth in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of ferritic stainless steel welds which improves joint strength. However, this technique seems to alter the martensite distribution in the high-temperature heat affected zone (HTHAZ) which is a critical constituent in rating the susceptibility to sensitization in ferritic stainless steel grades; any such information is not available in the literature. Thus, it is imperative to establish the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization dynamics in the HTHAZ. This paper discusses the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization in an AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel weld. It is established that cryogenic cooling increases the cooling rate in the HTHAZ and reduces the martensite volume percent by an average of 20%. This reduction in martensite content in the HTHAZ increases the level of ditched structure in cryogenically cooled welds and yields more ferrite-martensite ditched grain boundaries than in conventional welds. Although the cryotreated welds exhibit greater ditched boundary, the structure is still classified as nonsensitized, since no single grain boundary is completely surrounded by ditches.","title":"Exploratory study of sensitization in cryogenically cooled ferritic stainless steel welds","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"196","weight":0.2242,"docData":{"date":"29\/01\/18","money":"900","wordCount":"58","university":"B","abstract":"The first example of an all-organic oligofluorene truxene based distributed feedback laser for the detection of a specific protein\u2013small molecule interaction is reported.

However, the uniform production of SERS nanoparticle tags with high yield and brightness still remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe an approach based on the controlled co-adsorption of multiple dye species onto gold nanorods to create tags that can be detected across a much wider range of excitation wavelengths (514 \u2013 1064 nm) compared to conventional approaches that typically focus on a single wavelength. This was achieved without the added complexity of nanoparticle aggregation or growing surrounding metallic shells to further enhance the surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) signal. Correlated Raman and scanning electron microscopy mapping measurements of individual tags were used to clearly demonstrate that strong and reproducible SERRS signals at high particle yields (>92 %) were readily achievable. The polyelectrolyte-wrapped nanorod-dye conjugates were also found to be highly stable as well as non-cytotoxic. To demonstrate the use of these universal tags for the multimodal optical imaging of biological specimens, confocal Raman and fluorescence maps of stained immune cells following nanoparticle uptake were acquired at several excitation wavelengths and compared with dark-field images. The ability to colocalize and track individual\noptically encoded nanoparticles across a wide range of wavelengths simultaneously will enable the use of SERS alongside other imaging techniques for the real-time monitoring of cell-nanoparticle interactions.","title":"Universal surface-enhanced Raman tags: individual nanorods for measurements from the visible to the infrared (514 \u2013 1064 nm)","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"306","weight":0.223,"docData":{"date":"30\/01\/17","money":"298","wordCount":"157","university":"D","abstract":"Based on the fast spectral approximation to the Boltzmann collision operator, we present an accurate and efficient deterministic numerical method for solving the Boltzmann equation.

Recent experimental measurements of mass flow rates along a rectangular tube with large aspect ratio are compared with numerical results for the linearised Boltzmann equation. Then, a number of two-dimensional micro flows in the transition and free molecular flow regimes are simulated using the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. The influence of the molecular model is discussed, as well as the applicability of the linearised Boltzmann equation. For thermally driven flows in the free molecular regime, it is found that the magnitudes of the flow velocity are inversely proportional to the Knudsen number. The streamline patterns of thermal creep flow inside a closed\nrectangular channel are analysed in detail: when the Knudsen number is smaller than a critical value, the flow pattern can be predicted based on a linear superposition of the velocity profiles of linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep \nflows between parallel plates. For large Knudsen numbers, the flow pattern can be determined using the linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep velocity profiles at the critical Knudsen number.

India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7\u201337.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846\u2013$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children. Increasing all immunization rates to 90% (intervention two) averts an additional 22.1 (95% UR, 18.6\u201325.7) deaths and $45,914 (95% UR, $37,909\u2013$53,920) OOP expenditure. Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.","title":"Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"623","weight":0.2191,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/15","money":"309","wordCount":"105","university":"D","abstract":"This paper examines the origins of the infant mind in its first purposeful movements, evident in utero, and traces their development into complex projects of social meaning-making in the first year of life.

A narrow view of the process, one focused on short-term revenue maximisation principles, is inadequate due to secondary system elements that can impact technology commercialisation outcomes.

The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m.

The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue.

The proposed protection scheme provides ultrafast response and can be adapted to varied system operational modes, topologies, fault conditions, and load conditions. Only low-bandwidth communication is required to achieve high-speed operation and adequate discrimination level in meshed networks.

However the islands\u2019 position on the UK electrical grid\u2019s periphery, with restricted local network capacity and only a limited connection to \nthe mainland, makes it more challenging to capitalise on this advantage. This study sought to explore the relationship between the local wind and wave resources and consider how they track the islands\u2019 indigenous demand for electricity. This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand \ndata gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional \ngeneration available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from \nwind and wave sources.","title":"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"366","weight":0.1988,"docData":{"date":"26\/12\/18","money":"482","wordCount":"161","university":"B","abstract":"ES-62 is a phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing glycoprotein secreted by the filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae that acts to modulate the host immune response to promote the establishment of chronic helminth infection. Reflecting its anti-inflammatory actions, we have previously reported that ES-62 protects mice from developing Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA): thus, as this helminth-derived product may exhibit therapeutic potential in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is important to understand the protective immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by ES-62 in this model in vivo. We have established to date that ES-62 acts by downregulating pathogenic Th17\/IL-17-mediated responses and upregulating the regulatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, our studies have identified that IL-22, another member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, exerts dual pathogenic and protective roles in this model of RA with ES-62 harnessing the cytokine's inflammation-resolving and tissue repair properties in the joint during the established phase of disease. Here, we discuss the counter-regulatory roles of IL-22 in the murine model of CIA and present additional novel data showing that ES-62 selectively induces γδ T cells with the capacity to induce IL-22 production and that γδ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-22, but not IL-17, induced during CIA can be identified by their expression of TLR4. Moreover, we also show that treatment of mice undergoing CIA with the active PC moiety of ES-62, in the form of PC conjugated to BSA, is not only sufficient to mimic the ES-62-dependent suppression of pathogenic IL-17 responses shown previously but also that of the IL-22 and IL-10 up-regulation observed with the parasitic worm product during CIA. These findings not only reinforce the potential of IL-22, firstly described as a Th17-related pro-inflammatory cytokine, as a protective factor in arthritis but also suggest that drugs based on the PC moiety found in ES-62 may be able to harness the joint-protecting activities of IL-22 therapeutically.","title":"The parasitic worm product ES-62 up-regulates IL-22 production by γδ T cells in the murine model of collagen-induced arthritis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"444","weight":0.1988,"docData":{"date":"20\/01\/16","money":"456","wordCount":"156","university":"E","abstract":"The three-phase two-level voltage source converter (VSC) is widely employed in power conversions between AC and DC for its four-quadrant operation and control flexibility. However, it suffers from the low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, only half of the DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system. Experimental results have verified the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed configuration and the designed control strategies.","title":"Three-phase AC side voltage-doubling high power density voltage source converter with intrinsic buck-boost cell and common mode voltage suppression","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"2","weight":0.1986,"docData":{"date":"15\/09\/19","money":"431","wordCount":"136","university":"C","abstract":"This paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational waves from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB).

Distributions of ten representative zooplankton taxa, from recent (2000-2009) Continuous Plankton Recorder data, are presented, along with basin-scale patterns of annual sea surface temperature and phytoplankton color.  The distribution patterns represent the manifestation of very different physiological, life history and ecological interactions of each taxon with the North Atlantic habitat characteristics. The paper then focuses on a pan-Atlantic compilation of demographic and life history information for the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, perhaps one of the most ecologically important and certainly the most studied zooplankton species in the North Atlantic. Abundance, dormancy, egg production and mortality in relation to temperature and phytoplankton biomass, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, are analyzed in the context of understanding factors involved in determining the distribution and abundance of C. finmarchicus across its range. Several themes emerge:  (1)  transport of C. finmarchicus is from the south to the north in the northeast Atlantic, but from the north to the south in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses to climate forcing on coastal shelves, , (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east while it occurs after the bloom in many western sites, (3) while the deep basins in the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea are primary sources of C. finmarchicus production,  the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the western North Atlantic shelves, (4) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production responses, (5) differences in functional responses in egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (6) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, and (7) differences in stage-specific mortality rates are related to bathymetry, temperature and potential predators, notably the abundance of congeners Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis, which likely feed on early life stages of C. finmarchicus. Two modeling approaches have previously been used to interpret the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in relation to the North Atlantic habitat. A statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical modeling approach, based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history and implemented by recent developments in coupled physical-life cycle modeling. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. A synthesis of the two modeling approaches to predict North Atlantic zooplankton species shifts, not only for C. finmarchicus, but also for other major taxa, is advocated. While the computational resource requirements and lack of species-specific life history information for physical-biological modeling hinder full application for many zooplankton taxa, use of the approach, where possible, to understand advective influences will provide insight for interpretation of statistical predictions from species distribution models.","title":"The North Atlantic Ocean as habitat for Calanus finmarchicus: environmental factors and life history traits","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"339","weight":0.1892,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/16","money":"384","wordCount":"37","university":"C","abstract":"This article puts forward an economic case for Scotland staying in the union.

The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels, which creates another challenge. Therefore, the issues of voltage matching and DC fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed, where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv\/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels. Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode DC component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a DC to DC transformer where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an AC transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed DC transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability. The DC transformer facilitates DC voltage regulation and near instant isolation of DC faults within its protection zone. Analysis and simulations confirm these capabilities in a system-oriented approach.","title":"Quasi two-level operation of modular multilevel converter for use in a high-power DC transformer with DC fault isolation capability","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"75","weight":0.1866,"docData":{"date":"29\/11\/16","money":"532","wordCount":"134","university":"A","abstract":"Nurse scheduling is a critical issue in the management of emergency department. Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"668","weight":0.1865,"docData":{"date":"12\/10\/15","money":"518","wordCount":"59","university":"E","abstract":"The spectrum of the coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) of light by a rarefied gas is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation numerically using the fast spectral method.

The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"426","weight":0.1855,"docData":{"date":"21\/03\/16","money":"467","wordCount":"248","university":"D","abstract":"Impurity transport is a subject of fundamental importance in plasma physics in general and in tokamak physics in particular. The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"341","weight":0.1843,"docData":{"date":"26\/02\/16","money":"361","wordCount":"114","university":"D","abstract":"Invariance is of paramount importance in programming languages and in physics. In programming languages, John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields \"free\" theorems about programs just from their types. In physics, Emmy Noether showed that if the action of a physical system is invariant under change of coordinates, then the physical system has a conserved quantity: a quantity that remains constant for all time. Knowledge of conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems. For example, the conservation of energy is by Noether's theorem a consequence of a system's invariance under time-shifting.\n\nIn this paper, we link Reynolds' relational parametricity with Noether's theorem for deriving conserved quantities. We propose an extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms of their Lagrangians. We show, by constructing a relationally parametric model of our extension of Fω, that relational parametricity is enough to satisfy the hypotheses of Noether's theorem, and so to derive conserved quantities for free, directly from the polymorphic types of Lagrangians expressed in our system.","title":"From parametricity to conservation laws, via Noether's Theorem","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"175","weight":0.1843,"docData":{"date":"30\/11\/17","money":"484","wordCount":"76","university":"A","abstract":"We previously proposed a dual FEL configuration on the UV Demo FEL at\nJefferson Lab that would allow simultaneous lasing at FIR and UV wavelengths [1].

In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80km in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used. The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality plays a key role in the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4.

Description: We developed a Y-shaped chest tube with split ends that divide within the thoracic cavity, permitting separate intrathoracic placement and requiring a single exit port. In this study, thoracic drainage by the split drain vs. that of separate drains was tested.  Methods: After sternotomy, pericardiotomy, and left pleurotomy, pigs were fitted with separate chest drains (n=10) or a split tube prototype (n=9) with internal openings positioned in the mediastinum and in the costodiaphragmatic recess. Separate series of experiments were conducted to test drainage of D5W or 0.58 M sucrose, an aqueous solution with viscosity approximating that of plasma. One litre of fluid was infused into the thorax, and suction was applied at -20 cm H2O for 30 min.  Results: When D5W was infused, the split drain left a residual volume of 53±99 ml (mean value ± SD) vs. 148 ± 120 for the separate drain (P = 0.007), representing a drainage efficiency (i.e. drained vol\/[drained + residual vol]) of 95 ± 10% vs. 86 ± 12% for the separate drains (P = 0.011). In the second series, the split drain evacuated more 0.58 M sucrose in the first minute (967 ± 129 ml) than the separate drains (680 ± 192 ml, P<0.001). By 30 min, the split drain evacuated a similar volume of sucrose vs. the conventional drain (1089 ± 72 vs. 1056 ± 78 ml; P = 0.5). Residual volume tended to be lower (25 ± 10 vs. 62 ± 72 ml; P = 0.128) and drainage efficiency tended to be higher (98 ± 1 vs. 95 ± 6%; P = 0.111) with the split drain vs. conventional separate drains.

In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos.

Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts.

This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape.

The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"760","weight":0.1737,"docData":{"date":"20\/05\/15","money":"895","wordCount":"144","university":"A","abstract":"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders in which language is affected.

We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed HLA types.  Quantitative association analyses of imputed HLA types suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A1 was associated with a measure of short-term memory (P = 0.004) and A3 with expressive language ability (P = 0.006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B8 and HLA-DQA1*0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0.021, P = 0.034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0.013, P = 0.029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed HLA types indicated that the DR10 allele of HLA-DRB1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0.004, relative risk = 2.575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Aim: To determine whether higher FC levels in individuals with quiescent Crohn's disease are associated with clinical relapse over the ensuing 12 months. Methods: A single centre prospective study was undertaken in Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission attending for routine review. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the primary endpoint of clinical relapse by 12 months, based on FC at baseline, was calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves of time to relapse were based on the resulting optimal FC cutoff for predicting relapse. Results: Of 97 patients recruited, 92 were either followed up for 12 months without relapsing, or reached the primary endpoint within that period. Of these, 10 (11 had relapsed by 12 months. The median FC was lower for non-relapsers, 96?g\/g (IQR 39-237), than for relapsers, 414?g\/g (IQR 259-590), (p=0.005). The area under the ROC curve to predict relapse using FC was 77.4 An optimal cutoff FC value of 240?g\/g to predict relapse of quiescent Crohn's had sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 74.4 Negative predictive value was 96.8% and positive predictive value was 27.6 FC?240mug\/g was associated with likelihood of relapse 5.7 (95% CI 1.9-17.3) times higher within 2.3 years than lower values (p=0.002).

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.","title":"Quantum trajectories and open many-body quantum systems","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"651","weight":0.1676,"docData":{"date":"31\/08\/15","money":"607","wordCount":"179","university":"D","abstract":"Provision of optimal nutrition in children in critical care is often challenging.

Sites were rescreened at varying intervals from 1 to 48 hours after cleaning. Microbial growth was quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) per square centimeter and presence or absence of MSSA and MRSA at each site. The study was repeated 3 times at monthly intervals. There was an early and significant reduction in average ACC (360 sampled sites) from a before-cleaning level of 4.3 to 1.65 CFU\/cm2 at 1 hour after disinfectant cleaning ( ).

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment.

GC-DTPA-Gd conjugates of precisely controlled MWs were synthesised and evaluated in mice against Gd-DTPA using time series of high-resolution MRI images of trunk, head, and xenograft flank tumours. GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD). The kidneys showed early enhancement also, particularly in the renal pelvis, suggesting renal elimination. Imaging of the head with GC-DTPA-Gd allowed detailed anatomical identification of specific blood vessels in particular with the high MW CA agent. Sequential, high-resolution, isotropic imaging of established A431 xenograft flank tumours with DTPA-Gd and GC-DTPA-Gd demonstrated that the initial distribution of the contrast agents was well correlated with blood vessels and supply. In contrast, subsequent tissue transport was primarily by diffusion and limited by CA molecular weight. The data also highlight the role of heterogeneity in CA distribution which was more prominent for the high MW agent. Precise control of glycol chitosan (GC) polymer chemistry facilitates synthesis of a family of Gd-based MRI contrast agents of tuneable MW but otherwise identical physicochemical properties. Such agents allow isotropic high-resolution threedimensional imaging of MW dependent transport processes relevant to the clinical and pre-clinical prediction of drug transport processes.","title":"Size-tuneable nanometric MRI contrast agents for the imaging of molecular weight dependent transport processes","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"487","weight":0.1591,"docData":{"date":"01\/06\/17","money":"640","wordCount":"88","university":"A","abstract":"Traditional souqs in the Arabian Peninsula continue to be major focal points of trade, commerce, exchange, entertainment and social interaction.

This paper proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model which enables the prediction of the effect of antifouling coatings on frictional resistance. It also outlines details of CFD simulations of resistance tests on coated plates in a towing tank. Initially, roughness functions and roughness Reynolds numbers for several antifouling coatings were evaluated using an indirect method. Following this, the most suitable roughness function model for the coatings was employed in the wall-function of the CFD software. CFD simulations of towing tests were then performed and the results were validated against the experimental data given in the literature.

In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung.

The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).\n\nThere was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland.

For n = 3 there are three families that emanate from the equilibrium configurations of the satellites, while for n = 4 there are six such families as well as numerous additional connecting families. The families of periodic orbits are all of the horseshoe or tadpole type, and several have regions of neutral linear stability.","title":"Periodic orbits for 3 and 4 co-orbital bodies","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"116","weight":0.1459,"docData":{"date":"03\/05\/17","money":"252","wordCount":"96","university":"A","abstract":"Vinyl cyclopropane rearrangement (VCPR) has been utilised to synthesise a difluorinated cyclopentene stereospecifically and under mild thermal conditions.

In view of the decreasing levels of physical activity and motor skills in children over the past decades, an appropriate assessment and monitoring of motor competence in early childhood is invaluable, for both research and practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the convergent validity between two motor competence assessment tools: the Körperkoordinations Test für Kinder (KTK) and the Motoriktest für Vier- bis Sechsjährige Kinder (MOT 4-6). \nMethods and results: Five hundred and thirty 5- and 6- year-old children (277 ♂ and 253 ♀; mean age = 5.95; SD = 0.57) were tested by practiced assessors on the KTK and MOT 4-6 during the same day. From the raw scores, a Motor Quotient was calculated based on normative data of the KTK and MOT 4-6. A Pearson correlation demonstrated a moderately strong positive association between KTK Motor Quotient and MOT 4-6 Motor Quotient (r = 0.605). Crosstabs showed a fair level of agreement between the two tests (K = 0.313; p < 0.001). \nConclusion: These findings show that some evidence of convergent validity between KTK and MOT 4-6 is provided in present study.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"48","weight":0.142,"docData":{"date":"03\/09\/19","money":"891","wordCount":"162","university":"E","abstract":"While being overweight or obese in adolescence may have detrimental effects on academic attainment, the evidence base is limited by reliance on cross-sectional studies with small sample sizes, failure to take account of confounders and lack of consideration of potential mediators. The present study aimed to address these limitations and examine longitudinal associations between obesity in adolescence and academic attainment. Associations between weight status at 11 years old and academic attainment assessed by national tests at 11, 13 and 16 years were examined in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Healthy weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) Z-score <1.04; overweight as BMI Z-score 1.04-1.63; obesity as BMI Z-score 1.64.  Data from 5966 participants with objectively measured weight status were examined: 71.4% were healthy weight (1935 males; 2325 females), 13.3% overweight (372 males; 420 females) and 15.3% obese (448 males; 466 females).  Girls obese at 11 years had lower academic attainment at 11, 13 and 16 years compared with those of a healthy weight, even after controlling for a wide range of confounders. Associations between obesity and academic attainment were less clear in boys. The potential mediating effects of depressive symptoms, intelligence quotient (IQ) and age of menarche in girls were explored, but when confounders were included, there was no strong evidence for mediation.  For girls, obesity in adolescence has a detrimental impact on academic attainment 5 years later. Mental health, IQ and age of menarche did not mediate this relationship, suggesting that further work is required to understand the underlying mechanisms. Parents, education and public health policy makers should consider the wide reaching detrimental impact of obesity on educational outcomes in this age group.","title":"Obesity impairs academic attainment in adolescence: findings from ALSPAC, a UK cohort","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"705","weight":0.1415,"docData":{"date":"16\/04\/16","money":"459","wordCount":"198","university":"B","abstract":"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is often rooted in inappropriate antibiotic use, but poor water quality and inadequate sanitation exacerbate the problem, especially in emerging countries. An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by blaNDM-1 genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and blaNDM-1 genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about blaNDM-1 levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May\/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG) and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1 levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 ± 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 ± 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg-1)) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were very low across all sites (2.1 ± 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1)) in February in the Upper Ganges and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1 levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February and blaNDM-1 levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r=0.61; p=0.007). Given waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar; data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible \"hot spots\" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.","title":"Increased waterborne blaNDM-1 resistance gene abundances associated with seasonal human pilgrimages to the Upper Ganges River","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"275","weight":0.1415,"docData":{"date":"25\/03\/19","money":"503","wordCount":"99","university":"A","abstract":"Laser system industry is a complex network entity that includes laser component manufacturer, laser manufacturer, system integrator, laser job shop, laser process developer and end product manufacturer.

A full numerical description of fast electron generation and transport is found to reproduce the experimental absolute Kα yield and spot size measurements for varying target thicknesses, and to sequentially quantify the collisional and resistive electron stopping powers. The results demonstrate that both stopping mechanisms are enhanced in compressed Al samples and are attributed to the increase in the medium density and resistivity, respectively. For the achieved time- and space-averaged electronic current density, ⟨jh⟩∼8×1010\u2009A\/cm2 in the samples, the collisional and resistive stopping powers in warm and compressed Al are estimated to be 1.5\u2009keV\/μm and 0.8\u2009keV\/μm , respectively.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"375","weight":0.1389,"docData":{"date":"09\/10\/19","money":"138","wordCount":"36","university":"A","abstract":"The synthesis of N2-aryl 1,2,3-triazoles from 2,5-disubstituted tetrazoles was achieved under photochemical conditions.

The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.

Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight.

The variation in signal with depth is consistent with that observed previously for transmission Raman spectrometry. In both cases, the trend observed can be attributed to lower photon density at the air-sample interface, relative to the center of the sample, owing to loss of photons to the air.

Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, pitch actuator travel is reduced by 15 pitch rates by 23 and pitch accelerations by 42 This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades. It is also shown that this may be achieved while also using the smart rotor control for load reduction, though with reduced effectiveness.

Moreover, such electron beams can oscillate transversely (wiggling motion) in the laser-produced plasma bubble\/channel and emit collimated ultrashort X-ray flashes known as betatron radiation with photon energy ranging from kiloelectronvolts to mega-electronvolts. This implies that usually one cannot obtain bright betatron X-rays and high-quality electron beams with low emittance and small energy spread simultaneously in the same accelerating wave bucket. Here, we report the first (to our knowledge) experimental observation of two distinct electron bunches in a single laser shot, one featured with quasi-monoenergetic spectrum and another with continuous spectrum along with large emittance. The latter is able to generate high-flux betatron X-rays. Such is observed only when the laser self-guiding is extended over 4 mm at a fixed plasma density (4 × 1018 cm-3). Numerical simulation reveals that two bunches of electrons are injected at different stages due to the bubble evolution. The first bunch is injected at the beginning to form a stable quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, whereas the second one is injected later due to the oscillation of the bubble size as a result of the change of the laser spot size during the propagation. Due to the inherent temporal synchronization, this unique electron-photon source can be ideal for pump-probe applications with femtosecond time resolution.","title":"Concurrence of monoenergetic electron beams and bright X-rays from an evolving laser-plasma bubble","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"724","weight":0.1283,"docData":{"date":"31\/01\/16","money":"300","wordCount":"39","university":"E","abstract":"At present, much of the debate related to Scottish independence has tended to focus on shorter-term issues, especially on the likely fiscal position if Scotland were to become independent in 2015\/16.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"421","weight":0.1273,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/17","money":"730","wordCount":"55","university":"B","abstract":"Studies of a broad bandwidth, two-colour FEL amplier using one monoenergetic electron beam are presented.

When the plasma builds up, the radio wave is reflected at a lower altitude, and an ionization front is formed, rapidly descending to an altitude a few tens of kilometres below the initial critical layer. The ionization of the neutral gas is attributed to collisions with energetic electrons accelerated by the plasma wave turbulence. Numerical full-scale modeling of the Langmuir turbulence, electron acceleration and transport, and ionization processes are consistent with the observations. By a similarity principle, the experiment can be scaled down from the large-scale ionosphere to a metre-scale laboratory plasma, where microwaves are used instead of radio waves to induce the plasma turbulence.

The Trypanosoma brucei genome contains apparent orthologues of several autophagy-related proteins including an ATG8 family. These ubiquitin-like proteins are required for autophagosome membrane formation, but our studies show that ATG8.3 is atypical. To investigate the function of other ATG proteins, RNAi compatible T. brucei were modified to function as autophagy reporter lines by expressing only either YFP-ATG8.1 or YFP-ATG8.2. In the insect procyclic lifecycle stage, independent RNAi down-regulation of ATG3 or ATG7 generated autophagy-defective mutants and confirmed a pro-survival role for autophagy in the procyclic form nutrient starvation response. Similarly, RNAi depletion of ATG5 or ATG7 in the bloodstream form disrupted autophagy, but did not impede proliferation. Further characterisation showed bloodstream form autophagy mutants retain the capacity to undergo the complex cellular remodelling that occurs during differentiation to the procyclic form and are equally susceptible to dihydroxyacetone-induced cell death as wild type parasites, not supporting a role for autophagy in this cell death mechanism. The RNAi reporter system developed, which also identified TOR1 as a negative regulator controlling YFP-ATG8.2 but not YFP-ATG8.1 autophagosome formation, will enable further targeted analysis of the mechanisms and function of autophagy in the medically relevant bloodstream form of T. brucei.","title":"Tracking autophagy during proliferation and differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"174","weight":0.1238,"docData":{"date":"05\/06\/17","money":"413","wordCount":"97","university":"E","abstract":"The collimation of proton beams accelerated during ultra-intense laser irradiation of thin aluminum foils was measured experimentally whilst varying laser contrast.

In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"262","weight":0.12,"docData":{"date":"03\/09\/16","money":"522","wordCount":"75","university":"C","abstract":"This research responds to the need to study trust in the national government (national trust) and in local government (local trust) simultaneously and investigates how decentralization reshapes political attitudes toward different layers of government.

Structural and biophysical analyses show that recognition of CPA occurs through the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain of pyocin L1 and that this interaction is a prerequisite for bactericidal activity. Further to this, we show that the previously described lectin-like bacteriocin putidacin L1 shows a similar carbohydrate-binding specificity, indicating that oligosaccharides containing d-rhamnose and not d-mannose, as was previously thought, are the physiologically relevant ligands for this group of bacteriocins. The widespread inclusion of d-rhamnose in the lipopolysaccharide of members of the genus Pseudomonas explains the unusual genus-specific activity of the lectin-like bacteriocins.","title":"Lectin-like bacteriocins from pseudomonas spp. utilise D-rhamnose containing lipopolysaccharide as a cellular receptor","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"536","weight":0.1186,"docData":{"date":"03\/06\/19","money":"852","wordCount":"135","university":"B","abstract":"The aim of cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is to inform the allocation of scarce resources. CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"211","weight":0.1185,"docData":{"date":"30\/05\/16","money":"819","wordCount":"76","university":"D","abstract":"We develop a model to capture state-of-knowledge, as well as aleatory, uncertainties associated with off-shore wind farm technologies, processes and environments.

The rf output is near perpendicular to the electron beam with a slight backward-wave character reflected in the spectral output with a well defined peak at 2.68GHz, just below the relativistic electron cyclotron frequency. The corresponding rf conversion efficiency of 1.1% is comparable to waveguide bounded simulations and consistent with the predictions of kinetic theory that suggest efficient, spectrally well defined radiation emission can be obtained from an electron horseshoe distribution in the absence of radiation boundaries.","title":"Numerical simulation of unconstrained cyclotron resonant maser emission","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"742","weight":0.1171,"docData":{"date":"07\/02\/16","money":"172","wordCount":"94","university":"B","abstract":"The effect of electric-current pulses on the evolution of microstructure and texture in cryogenically rolled copper was determined.

A significant portion of the recrystallization process was concluded to have occurred after pulsing; i.e., during cooling to ambient temperature. The grain structure and microhardness were shown to vary noticeably in the heat-affected zone (HAZ); these observations mirrored variations of temper colors. Accordingly, the revealed microstructure heterogeneity was attributed to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution developed during pulsing. In the central part of the HAZ, the mean grain size increased with current density and this effect was associated with the temperature rise per se.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"437","weight":0.1152,"docData":{"date":"25\/06\/16","money":"965","wordCount":"165","university":"B","abstract":"Image making is a continuous worldwide practice of architects and designers whose concern is to create meaningful environments. Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"334","weight":0.114,"docData":{"date":"16\/03\/15","money":"298","wordCount":"79","university":"E","abstract":"Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), constitutes the demands that teachers are supposed to meet.

On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.","title":"Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"493","weight":0.1053,"docData":{"date":"19\/11\/18","money":"385","wordCount":"152","university":"A","abstract":"Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for the treatment of adolescent obesity have taken place outside the western world.

Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"751","weight":0.1042,"docData":{"date":"05\/11\/16","money":"312","wordCount":"48","university":"C","abstract":"The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill completed Stage 2 of the legislative process on 21 January 2014.

Viewing place as a symbolic part of the consumption process, a \"Model of Festival Place\" is developed. This advances theories that presuppose environment as nothing more than a context for consumption. Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?

Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed lambda-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F.  This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity.","title":"A relationally parametric model of dependent type theory","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"589","weight":0.1035,"docData":{"date":"28\/01\/15","money":"184","wordCount":"58","university":"A","abstract":"WC-6Co cemented carbide was manufactured successfully by coupled multi-physical fields activated technology with the Gleeble-1500 thermal simulation equipment for the reason of studying the effect of sintering temperature on the densification and microstructures of samples sintered under multi-physical fields.

Transmission and reception of ultrasound is effected via controlled electrical or mechanical stimulus of the membrane, respectively. The dimensions of the cavity and the mechanical properties of the membrane determine the vibrational behavior of the resultant transducer. This paper employs a facile process for the micropatterning of polymer substrates for the manufacture of capacitive transducers. A positive mask of the desired cavity microstructure is deposited onto a polystyrene substrate. The substrate is then exposed to a saturated toluene vapour which is absorbed by the polystyrene causing swelling of the surface except in the areas where the droplets are situated resulting in the formation of micro-cavities at the position of each droplet. The PZFlex finite element (FE) software, deployed on custom cloud computing architecture allowing for 1000\u2019s of simultaneous parallel simulations, has been employed to explore the potential for the use of the micropatterned substrates in the manufacture of capacitive ultrasonic transducers. This new cloud approach has facilitated reducing months of intensive FE modelling to a few days.

Electron transfer from a complex formed from potassium tert-butoxide with additives, such as phenanthroline, has been suggested to initiate the radical process. However, our computational results encouraged us to search for alternatives. We report that heterocycle-derived organic electron donors achieve the coupling reactions and these donors can form in situ in the above cases. We show that an electron transfer route can operate either with phenanthrolines as additives or using pyridine as solvent, and we propose new heterocyclic structures for the respective electron donors involved in these cases. In the absence of additives, and with appropriate substrates, the coupling reactions are still successful although more sluggish,, and benzynes are proposed to play crucial roles in the initiation process in these cases.","title":"Organic super-electron-donors: initiators in transition metal-free haloarene-arene coupling","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"687","weight":0.0988,"docData":{"date":"10\/09\/16","money":"814","wordCount":"162","university":"A","abstract":"In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of CubeSats to perform research in the realms of microgravity and earth observation. Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.","title":"Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"796","weight":0.0981,"docData":{"date":"13\/02\/19","money":"370","wordCount":"51","university":"B","abstract":"The Scottish NHS faces a crisis of affordability in the next couple of decades as the population ages and demands on services intensify.

Specifically, the effect of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport is explored. The first investigation explores fast electron transport in allotropes of carbon by measuring the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of protons accelerated from the target rear-surface. An analytical model is developed which accounts for the rear-surface fast electron sheath dynamics, ionisation and projection of the resulting beam of protons, and is used (in conjunction with the experimental measurements) to infer annular fast electron beam transport with lamentary structure in 200 um-thick diamond targets. The important role that material lattice structure has in defining electrical resistivity, which in turn defines the fast electron transport properties, is established utilising three-dimensional hybrid pa rticle-in-cell (3D hybrid-PIC) simulations together with an analytical model of the resistive lamentation instability. The second investigation explores fast electron transport in silicon utilising both experimental measurements and 3D hybrid-PIC simulations. Annular fast electron transport is demonstrated and explained by resistively generated magnetic fields. The results indicate the potential to completely transform the beam transport pattern by tailoring the resistivity-temperature profile at temperatures as low as a few eV. Additionally, the sensitivity of annular fast electron beam transport is explored by varying the drive laser pulse parameters (i.e. energy, focal spot radius and pulse duration) and is found to be particularly sensitive to the peak laser pulse intensity. An ability to optically 'tune' the properties of an annular fast electron transport pattern may be important for applications. In the final investigation the effect that initial target temperature, and thus lattice melt, has on fast electron transport properties is demonstrated. Laser-accelerated proton beams are used to isochorically heat silicon for several tens-of-picoseconds prior to the propagation of fast electrons through the pre-heated target. This enables the influence of resistivity gradients, generated by proton-induced lattice melt, on fast electron transport properties to be explored. The experimental observation of an annular proton beam after t heat = 30 ps of proton pre-heating, which corresponds to annular electron transport within the target, is in excellent qualitative agreement with 3-D hybrid-PIC simulations of fast electron transport in a target containing an initial temperature (and thus, resistivity) gradient.","title":"Effects of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport in relativistic laser-solid interactions","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"744","weight":0.0968,"docData":{"date":"25\/12\/17","money":"646","wordCount":"31","university":"E","abstract":"This article puts forward an economic case for Scotland becoming independent.

A feasibility study of reading comprehension strategies with good evidence of efficacy was undertaken in three mainstream primary schools in an area of social deprivation in west central Scotland, to decide whether further investigation of this intervention was warranted.\nAims were to measure comprehension of spoken language and reading via standardised assessments towards the beginning of the school year (T1) in mainstream primary school classrooms within an area of social deprivation; to have teachers introduce previously-validated text comprehension strategies, and to measure change in reading comprehension outcome measures towards the end of the year (T2). \nA pre- and post-intervention cohort design was used. Reading comprehension strategies were introduced to staff in participating schools and used throughout the school year as part of on-going reading instruction. Spoken language comprehension was measured by TROG-2 at T1, and reading progress by score changes T1-T2 on the WIAT-IIUK-T reading comprehension scale. \nForty-seven pupils in five classes in three primary schools took part: 38% had TROG-2 scores below the 10th centile. As a group, children made good reading comprehension progress, with a medium standardised effect size of 0.46. Children with TROG-2 scores below 10%ile had lower mean reading scores than others at T1 and T2, although with considerable overlap. However, TROG-2 did not make a unique contribution to reading progress: children below 10%ile made as much progress as other children. The outcomes suggest this intervention warrants further investigation in larger, controlled, studies.","title":"Developing a universal reading comprehension intervention for mainstream primary schools within areas of social deprivation for children with and without language-learning impairment: a feasibility study","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"358","weight":0.0931,"docData":{"date":"17\/09\/16","money":"681","wordCount":"86","university":"D","abstract":"This paper draws on qualitative and quantitative data from a survey of youth justice practitioners' and managers' experience of the implementation and use of movement restriction conditions (MRCs) in Scotland.

Patients with physician-diagnosed asthma or COPD who received maintenance therapy between January 2008 and December 2009 were included. Five classes of therapy were assessed: inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, combination therapy inhalers, theophyllines and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Adherence was calculated using the medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the time to discontinuation (TTD) over 1 year. Two step-wise logistic regressions were performed to assess the contribution of diagnosis to adherence\/persistence.  A total of 13,322 patients were included in the analysis: 10,521 patients with asthma and 2801 patients with COPD. 25.2% of medication episodes for asthma and 45.6% of medication episodes for COPD were classified as having an adequate medication supply (MPR of 80-120%). The overall median TTD was 92 days (IQR, interquartile range: 50-186 days) for patients with asthma and 116 days (IQR: 58-259 days, comparison p < 0.001) for patients with COPD. Patients with COPD were found to be more likely to achieve an MPR of at least 80% (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15-1.40), but had a similar likelihood of persistence at 1 year to patients with asthma.

Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells. These findings indicate that SK1 or SK2 represent potential targets for treating T-ALL.","title":"Assessment of the effect of sphingosine kinase inhibitors on apoptosis,unfolded protein response and autophagy of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells; indications for novel therapeutics","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"652","weight":0.091,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/18","money":"369","wordCount":"132","university":"E","abstract":"The significance continues to grow of scholarship that embraces critical and contextualized entrepreneurship, seeking rich explorations of diverse entrepreneurship contexts.

We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed 'Game theoretic risks' in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing's perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap. Successful application of the framework justifies its potential for further testing in other supply chain risk quantification scenarios.","title":"A novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"287","weight":0.0846,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/16","money":"397","wordCount":"71","university":"A","abstract":"The ionization-induced injection in laser wakefield acceleration has been recently demonstrated to be a promising injection scheme.

As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation\u2019s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences.

These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.","title":"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"750","weight":0.079,"docData":{"date":"28\/09\/19","money":"654","wordCount":"190","university":"B","abstract":"Establishing day-case surgery as the preferred hospital admission route for all eligible patients requires adequate preoperative assessment of patients in order to quickly distinguish those who will require minimum assessment and are suitable for day-case admission from those who will require more extensive management and will need to be admitted as inpatients.

We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway.

Furthermore, as the case law analysis demonstrates, the traditional hierarchy of rights by which civil and political rights were prioritised over their economic and social counterparts, has given way to an EU legal order whereby the economic imperative remains paramount with social provisions, in the context of labour rights, subjugated and subject to further divisions.","title":"The EU and the ECHR: collective and non-discrimination labour rights at a crossroad?","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"778","weight":0.0782,"docData":{"date":"11\/12\/15","money":"768","wordCount":"64","university":"D","abstract":"This paper aims to scope out some of the implications of desistance research for the community management of high risk offenders.

Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their \u2018feet on the ground\u2019 where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for \u2018generation bagging\u2019  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.  We contribute to heritage tourism studies by revealing how extensive and well preserved archives, local knowledge and a passion for family history can serve to generate unique and deeply emotional tourism experiences for ancestral tourists. Despite the often \u2018cottage industry\u2019 nature of many ancestral attractions (often reliant on volunteers and local \u2018good will) the outcome of the visit can often be greater satisfaction and a strong repeat visitation pattern.","title":"Connecting with the past: meeting the needs of ancestral tourists in Scotland","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"633","weight":0.0758,"docData":{"date":"24\/09\/15","money":"526","wordCount":"66","university":"A","abstract":"The influence of lattice-melt-induced resistivity gradients on the transport of mega-ampere currents of fast electrons in solids is investigated numerically and experimentally using laser-accelerated protons to induce isochoric heating.

The two-step processed CIGS films were mechanically compressed at 25 MPa to improve their optoelectronic properties, which were verified by photoluminescence (PL). The surface and structural properties were compared before and after compression. The mechanical compression has brought changes in the surface morphology and porosity without changing the structural properties of the material. The PL technique has been used to reveal changes in the electronic properties of the films. PL spectra at different excitation laser powers and temperatures were measured for as-grown as well as compressed samples. The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation. The compression increases the intensity of energy bands by an order of magnitude and reduces the j-shift, demonstrating an improvement of the electronic properties.","title":"Effect of mechanical compression on Cu(In,Ga)Se films: micro-structural and photoluminescence analysis","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"55","weight":0.075,"docData":{"date":"03\/12\/16","money":"259","wordCount":"40","university":"A","abstract":"We consider a broad area vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser(VCSEL) subject to optical injection.

Following a comprehensive process of academic review of articles and research work submitted to the journal, it has succeeded to secure its position in various databases. One of the unique features of the Archnet-IJAR was, and still is, the voluntary work nature of its editors and reviewers where no funds are involved at all in managing or reviewing or editing the submissions before publishing. Another unique feature is that the journal since the beginning was, and still is, made available for free without subscription fees or publishing fees. A third feature of Archnet-IJAR is the opportunity it offers to young academics, PhD scholars, reaching across the boundaries of cultures and regions.\n\nKey highlights in the past seven years are important to note. In qualitative and quantitative terms the journal has made significant achievements. In terms of quality the journal became part of important data and index bases including Avery index to Architectural Periodicals, EBSCO-Current Abstracts-Art and Architecture, INTUTE, Directory of Open Access Journals, Pro-Quest, Scopus-Elsevier and many university library databases. In terms of quantity 20 issues were published in 7 volumes (Figure 1). The 20 issues combined include 283 papers categorized in two categories: 237 original research articles and 46 book reviews and trigger articles.

To identify anticonvulsant secondary metabolites, we performed an in vivo, zebrafish-based screen of medicinal plants used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of seizures. Solanum torvum Sw. (Solanaceae) was identified as having significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish larvae with seizures induced by the GABAA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). This finding correlates well with the ethnomedical use of this plant in the Philippines, where a water decoction of S. torvum leaves is used to treat epileptic seizures. HPLC microfractionation of the bioactive crude extract, in combination with the in vivo zebrafish seizure assay, enabled the rapid localization of several bioactive compounds that were partially identified on-line by UHPLC-TOF-MS as steroid glycosides. Targeted isolation of the active constituents from the methanolic extract enabled the complete de novo structure identification of the six main bioactive compounds that were also present in the traditional preparation. To partially mimic the in vivo metabolism of these triterpene glycosides, their common aglycone was generated by acid hydrolysis. The isolated molecules exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish seizure assays. These results underscore the potential of zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation to rapidly identify novel bioactive small molecules of natural origin.","title":"Zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation identifies anticonvulsant steroid glycosides from the Philippine medicinal plant Solanum torvum","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"611","weight":0.0715,"docData":{"date":"15\/10\/15","money":"185","wordCount":"56","university":"D","abstract":"The directive 2011\/36\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5th April 2011) defines trafficking as \u201Cthe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

This process is associated with inflammation, bone loss and implant loosening and led to the withdrawal from the market of the DePuy ASR™ MoM hip replacements in 2010. Ions released from CoCr particles derived from a resurfacing implant in vitro and their subsequent cellular up-take were measured by ICP-MS. Moreover, the ability of such metal debris and Co ions to induce both apoptosis was evaluated with both FACS and immunoblotting. qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects on the expression of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG1), nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible (NOS2), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A). ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions. There was also an increase (p < 0.05) in apoptosis after a 48 h exposure to wear debris. Analysis of qRT-PCR results found significant up-regulation (p < 0.05) particularly of NOS2 and BAG1 in Co pre-treated cells which were subsequently exposed to Co ions + debris. Metal debris was more effective as an inducer of apoptosis and gene expression when cells had been pre-treated with Co ions. This suggests that if a patient receives sequential bilateral CoCr implants, the second implant may be more likely to produce adverse effects than the first one.","title":"CoCr wear particles generated from CoCr alloy metal-on-metal hip replacements, and cobalt ions stimulate apoptosis and expression of general toxicology-related genes in monocyte-like U937 cells","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"31","weight":0.065,"docData":{"date":"29\/11\/19","money":"467","wordCount":"154","university":"D","abstract":"While exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a recognized risk factor for cataract, its association is more controversial with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

However, the issue of potential spillover effects on energy demand (and supply) from energy efficiency improvements in one region\/nation on others have generally been neglected (Madlener and Alcott, 2009; Sorrell, 2009; Turner, 2013; Van den Bergh, 2011). This paper considers how the concept and consideration of economy-wide or 'macro-level' rebound may be extended to consider the impacts of increased energy efficiency in one country on energy use in others. While basic theoretical contributions on the issue of \u2018global rebound\u2019 have been made (e.g. Wei, 2010) and some applied studies have been conducted (e.g. Barker et al., 2009), there exist no applied macro-level rebound studies to date that attempt to fully consider and identify the types of channels through which energy efficiency increases in one region\/nation may impact energy demand and supply conditions in others. This is an important knowledge gap, particularly given the global nature of energy-related climate change and the context of supra-national policy targets such as the EU 20-20-20 framework. The potential for energy efficiency policy actions taken in one country to impact energy use (and related emissions) in others implies that target setting and implementation decisions in different member states may not be regarded as independent.","title":"Beyond national economy-wide rebound effects: an applied general equilibrium analysis incorporating international spillover effects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"253","weight":0.0613,"docData":{"date":"04\/05\/15","money":"577","wordCount":"49","university":"A","abstract":"Investigation has been undertaken at the University of Strathclyde to simulate, design and construct a klystron amplifier with an operating frequency of 94 GHz.

Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally.

A frequency of 61 kHz improved UEGT efficiency by ~70 % higher, but 99 kHz impeded UEGT to an extent worse than no ultrasound exposure.

Speech and language therapists (SLTs), educational psychologists and teachers are sometimes called upon by caregivers to provide advice on whether or how children and young people with language impairments should be encouraged to use these media. This article aims to illuminate some of the key issues and to review the implications of different types of advice that practitioners might provide. Four broad strategies are considered: Prohibition, Laissez-faire, Restriction, and Constructive use. Possible consequences of each strategy are outlined and it is proposed that Constructive use should be the strategy of choice. Reasons in favour of a constructive orientation include the benefits of joint engagement, enjoyment, cognitive and perceptual challenges and social motivation; effective uses can support educational attainment in young people with language impairments. Some areas where children and young people with language impairments need support with new media are noted. Decisions that we make about whether to constrain or support uses of new media have direct implications for the quality of young people\u2019s lives and futures. SLTs, educational psychologists and teachers have important roles to play in the development of better-informed policies and strategies concerning language impaired youngsters and digital media.","title":"Turn off or tune in?

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"62","weight":0.0536,"docData":{"date":"29\/03\/19","money":"465","wordCount":"56","university":"C","abstract":"This third paper offers some summary thoughts on the manner in which the political context and the nature of the political interaction bear on the evolution of the economic perspective in the Referendum and thereby on the understanding and insights of public opinion at large.

It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services.

We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991\u20132011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

The aim of this paper is to investigate this effect of PEF treatment on microalgae. The PEF system used in this paper consists of a pulse generator and treatment cell with parallel-plane metallic electrodes. The PEF treatment of microalgae, Spirulina, was conducted using 33.3- and 66.7-kV\/cm electric field impulses. The efficiency of the PEF treatment for inactivation of microalgae was assessed by comparison of the growth curves of PEF-treated and untreated samples. Results showed that growth of microalgae can be stopped by the application between 100 and 500 high-field impulses with field magnitude 33.3 kV\/cm. When the field is increased to a magnitude of 66.7 kV\/cm, the growth of microalgae can be stopped by application of 50 impulses. Overall, this paper confirms that PEF treatments can be used for the inactivation of algae and the energy consumption of the PEF process can be reduced using suspensions with lower electrical conductivity.","title":"Pulsed electric field treatment of microalgae: inactivation tendencies and energy consumption","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"733","weight":0.042,"docData":{"date":"01\/10\/15","money":"747","wordCount":"286","university":"A","abstract":"Purpose: Supply chain risk management is still an active area of research that necessitates application of existing risk quantification techniques in established fields for potential application in the research area. This study is focused on bridging the research gap through development of a novel risk management framework that merges the two quantitative techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief networks capture the interdependency between various risk factors while Game theory models the risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders in a supply network. The proposed framework segregates risk drivers, events and consequences and captures their interdependency. Development project of Boeing 787 aircraft was a unique venture in terms of its unconventional supply chain and unproven technology. Instead of the realization of anticipated shorter development time and reduced costs, the project turned out to be a fiasco. A new term \u2018game theoretic risks\u2019 has been coined to acknowledge the risks associated with conflicting incentives of various stakeholders in a supply network. \n\nResearch Approach: This study has focused on a review of the literature for establishing the research gap followed by designing of a novel framework (conceptual model) for quantification and management of supply chain risks. Subsequently, the model has been applied on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft.\n\nFindings and Originality: The developed framework is unique in its design merging two quantitative techniques in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management. Application of the novel framework on a case study of Boeing 787 project revealed its merits in terms of capturing the dynamics of interacting risk factors. Bayesian belief network is a useful modelling technique for risk quantification capturing the interdependency between various risks. Game theoretic modelling provides an opportunity to model the risks associated with conflicting incentives of the stakeholders within a supply network. Game theory based modelling captured the behaviour of suppliers in relation to the uncertainty about cost functions and the final response of Boeing to the delays caused by suppliers. The results clearly manifested importance of the game theoretic risks and as there was no policy to align the incentives of suppliers in Boeing 787 project, there was a major delay causing financial penalty to Boeing. Furthermore, lack of management expertise in Supply Chain Risk Management was a major factor for the higher development cost. It has been proved that lack of information in a supply chain affects the desired objectives of a project. To our best knowledge, such a framework has never been developed and applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management.\n\nResearch Impact: The output of this study will help researchers model the supply chain risks in a more realistic way and stimulate further research in this direction.\n\nPractical Impact: The application of our developed model on a case study reveals its practical impact. Had the Boeing considered the holistic view of the supply chain risks, the project delay and financial loss would not have materialized. Our model can be utilized in supply networks of other industries.","title":"Quantification of supply chain risks: development and application of a novel risk management framework","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"73","weight":0.0417,"docData":{"date":"09\/12\/19","money":"978","wordCount":"24","university":"A","abstract":"The grounds of referral to the Children\u2019s Reporter are found under s67(2) of the new act.

Water governance is defined here as a process in which law has a transformational role by allowing policy goals to become tangible and enforceable rights and obligations. Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further harmonisation is needed, but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively. It is within this context that the UNCSD can be seen as an international agenda setting process and three key water related topics appear to be on such agenda: water and sanitation; water and ecosystem services and water and climate change. The paper concludes with a call in favor of considering water not just as a public good, but mainly as a driver for sustainable development.","title":"Water governance in the aftermath of Rio+20","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"446","weight":0.0393,"docData":{"date":"08\/11\/15","money":"449","wordCount":"102","university":"D","abstract":"Leading firms in energy and transport production seek to make ethanol a \u2018global commodity\u2019 and stretch their operations across spatial boundaries.

Education for Citizenship, as opposed to Citizenship Education, in Scotland is not a discrete subject; the objective is that citizenship permeates everything that happens throughout school, academically and socially. It is centrally situated alongside children becoming \u2018effective contributors\u2019, \u2018successful learners\u2019 and \u2018confident individuals\u2019. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of Community of Philosophical Inquiry (CoPI) as a pedagogical tool to enhance citizenship attributes in Scottish children in a range of educational settings. In order, first, to get an insight into the teachers\u2019 perspectives on the Education for Citizenship agenda in Scotland, the teachers were asked for their definitions of \u2018citizen\u2019. Similarly, the children were also asked about their notion of \u2018citizen\u2019. The children\u2019s group betrayed a more political understanding of \u2018citizen\u2019 than the teachers. Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as \u2018informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues\u2019. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children\u2019s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI. The article uses contributions from the children to highlight areas of their lives within school and in society beyond school, where\ndoing philosophy has had an impact. The implications both for education for citizenship and the potential of Philosophy with Children to contribute to an enhanced school curriculum will also be discussed.","title":"Community of philosophical inquiry:  citizenship in Scottish classrooms","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"553","weight":0.039,"docData":{"date":"04\/08\/19","money":"801","wordCount":"77","university":"A","abstract":"In September 2012, the Scottish Government hosted a Women's Employment Summit in Edinburgh.

Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the last 6 quarters. In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter. The favourable gap between Scotland and UK manufacturing performance during the recovery therefore continues to be large. In Scottish construction whi le growth in the sector has picked up since the heavy recession period of 2010q4 to 2012q1 performance appears to have weakened relative to the UK from the start of last year. The sector is still very much depressed in both the UK and Scotland. However, the recent stronger performance of UK construction is evident with GVA in the sector in the third quarter -10.9% below its pre -recession peak compared to -13.6% in Scotland. Business and financial services continue to contribute positively to the growth of t he Scottish economy. By the latest quarter, the sector in the UK had moved to +1.3% above its pre-recession peak from -0.4% in the previous quarter, while its Scottish counterpart moved further ahead to stand at 2.2% above its pre-recession peak.

The PCEPS consists of 15 items with two subscales: Person Centred Process, and Experiential Process. Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were counsellors in training. Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred\u2019, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98).

Pioneered in Sweden, this approach considers prostitution as inherently oppressive and seeks to tackle the dynamics of supply and demand by criminalizing purchasers and offering support to sellers who are regarded as victims. Against recent calls from both the European Parliament and an All Party Parliamentary Group on prostitution to universalize this model, we urge caution against moving any further in this direction. Our argument is informed, not only by critical accounts of the \u2018Nordic model\u2019, but also by emerging research which highlights the negative effects of recent criminal and \u2018therapeutic\u2019 interventions in England and Wales that have already attempted to reduce the demand and supply of commercial sex: the strict liability offence of paying for sexual services of a prostitute subject to exploitation and Engagement and Support Orders (ESOs) for on-street sex workers. We offer both normative insights and draw upon the findings of the first empirical study of ESOs, in order to highlight the problems that emerge when the complexities of commercial sexual exchange are reduced into a binary of \u2018victims and victimizers\u2019 to be saved or corrected by criminal justice sanctioned initiatives. In conclusion, we argue for a more productive use of the criminal law that complements rather than eclipses the wider social justice concerns in this arena.","title":"A critical account of a 'creeping neo-abolitionism': regulating prostitution in England and Wales","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"251","weight":0.0236,"docData":{"date":"03\/12\/17","money":"133","wordCount":"85","university":"D","abstract":"This review is the first of three reports from a study of the potential effects of the Public Services (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014 and the resultant integration of (adult) health and social care services on children and young people in Scotland and the services they use.

You reach the darkest point when you are in the deepest. Then, as you start your way out, there is gradually more and more light. Over the last quarter century we were getting deeper and deeper in. It seems that it is starting to get lighter now.\n\nAs academics and consultants we have been working for, with and on top-level business decision takers involved in loosely structured decision problems. Gradually we have achieved better and better understanding of the models of thinking that can be useful for these decision takers. First we realized that the model of thinking needs to be simple; which is the philosophical commonplace of Occam\u2019s razor. Somewhat later we realized that it is easy to cut our-selves if Occam\u2019s razor is too sharp \u2013 the model of thinking must not be too simple as it will fail to provide a usable representation of reality. This is also known from philosophy as Einstein\u2019s extension of Occam\u2019s rule: as simple as possible but not simpler than that. Along these lines we have developed the Doctus knowledge-based system shell, for building our models. This way we started building the bridge of trans-disciplinarity between the knowledge do-mains of various experts. However, this bridge is narrow and difficult to use for crossing the disciplinary divides. Decision takers cannot walk the bridge alone; they need a bridge-guide called the knowledge engineer. The knowledge engineer is not a polymath (expert in multiple domains); the knowledge engineer\u2019s expertise is about knowledge and knowers.\n\nMore recently we have realized that it is not sufficient if the model is useful, it also has to be usable. The bridge should be wide, stable and easy to walk. Of course, it is still nice to have the knowledge engineer to guide the decision taker \u2013 it provides a fuller experience. What makes for such bridge? Today we think that we need to apply Occam\u2019s razor tempered by Einstein on the user interface the same way as we have previously used it for representing knowledge.

Given the fact that young Iranians\u2019 cultural consumption practices have often been analysed with reference to their receptivity to the global cultural flow (or what generally is perceived as westernisation), findings in this study provide a counterargument stressing that religiosity, nationalism and patriotism play an important role in people\u2019s sense of identity and preference for their own cultural practices and resources.","title":"Reflections on young Iranians' ethnocentric behaviours: evidence from consumer culture","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"510","weight":0.0118,"docData":{"date":"25\/08\/19","money":"388","wordCount":"85","university":"C","abstract":"In this article, Meer tentatively delineates three ways in which he understands that the concept of Islamophobia is being informed by postcolonial scholarship. The first functions as continuity, in so far as it is claimed that historical colonial dynamics are reproduced in contemporary postcolonial environments, broadly conceived. The second involves translation. This is related to the first but different in that it focuses in particular on the utility of Orientalist critique for the concept of Islamophobia. The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that \u2018the making of Muslims\u2019 is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider \u2018decentring\u2019 of the West. Meer argues that this third framing rests on terrain that is also populated by scholarship beyond the postcolonial tradition. This is because it expresses a story of how Muslims have contested and sought revisions to existing citizenship settlements, not least the ways in which approaches to anti-discrimination are configured. This is a story that is observable within imperfect liberal democratic frameworks that contain some institutional levers through which to challenge Islamophobia.","title":"Islamophobia and postcolonialism: continuity, Orientalism and Muslim consciousness","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"320","weight":0.0115,"docData":{"date":"31\/08\/18","money":"860","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"The paper informs on the emerging innovative solutions and practice in strengthening the resilience of architectural and urban heritage in Scotland in the context of key global risks such as peak oil, climate change, growing global population and species extinction.

This research investigated the discoloration ofmethylene blue using a specially-configured dielectric barrier discharge reactor, where the plasma was injected into the methylene blue solution through micro-holes to initiate the oxidation reactions at different pH values of 2.9, 7.1 and 11. The degradation effects from hydroxyls and ozone were determined separately by using the radical scavenger Tert-butanol. The results demonstratethat methylene blue is degraded by both ozone and reactive hydroxyl radicals,with the latter contributing up to 30% of the discoloration effect depending onsolution pH values.

The Lab took place in June 2015.\n\nThe Experience Lab aimed to co-create scenarios in which digital interventions could be used as motivation to increase the level of physical activity for dads, as a means of reducing the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. We looked at how the daily life of the men taking part had changed when they became a dad, how these changes possibly influenced their level of physical activity, and what would motivate them to become more active.\n\nThe Lab provided a safe and creative environment through which the Lab team helped participants (\u201Cexperienced dads\u201D) to feel comfortable to share stories, reflect on their lives and explore their motivations. The information gathered was then used to co-create possible scenarios for ways in which digital interventions could motivate the participants to enjoy an active everyday life.\n\nA series of activities including a physical work out, fireplace story sharing, mapping and a co-creation session were designed to gain insights into what appropriate support for dads in maintaining an active lifestyle would look like.\n\nThe outputs from the Lab included audio, photos, videos and field notes which were analysed for emerging themes.\n\nThe Experience Lab showed that a key to maintaining an active lifestyle is balancing a man\u2019s time as a dad and his personal time, which was described as very challenging by the participants. Whether you need to sleep, go to the pub, work in the garden or go for a run, it is that time for yourself that most men feel like they must give up once they become a dad. It became apparent that the activities participants engaged in during the Lab day served as a moment to reflect on the balance of their lives. More than the solutions co-created, the greatest value was gained from the activity of reflecting and identifying different stages in their lives with accompanying behavioural changes.\n\nIt should be noted that the Lab involved a small number of participants, but that the intimate setting allowed participants to feel comfortable to share experiences on an emotional level, which made it possible to gather the qualitative insights included in our report.","title":"Boys and their Toys","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"610","weight":0.0105,"docData":{"date":"20\/04\/17","money":"638","wordCount":"96","university":"C","abstract":"As curricular development in Scotland espoused the importance of pupil participation, the extent to which this has been embedded across teachers\u2019 pedagogy into assessment and reporting practices warranted investigation.

Findings revealed that pupils did not attend meetings but were relied upon as a source of preparation by attending parents.

This paper explores the safeguarding concerns and responses for children and young people who run away or go missing from home. The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.","title":"'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"448","weight":0.0098,"docData":{"date":"05\/04\/16","money":"852","wordCount":"103","university":"E","abstract":"This article engages with the influential narrative about the co-optation of feminism in conditions of neoliberalism put forward by prominent feminist thinkers Nancy Fraser, Hester Eisenstein and Angela McRobbie.

Taken together, these problems render the conclusions of Fraser, Eisenstein and McRobbie at best unconvincing and at worst dismissive of contemporary feminist efforts to challenge neoliberalism.

The author\u2019s practitioner background (as a branding consultant), coupled with his academic insight, has equipped him with a binocular to spot the urgency for strategic branding amongst businesses and organisations emerging from or entering Muslim contexts. The main value of the book lies in its discussion of the socio-cultural and economic characteristics of this diverse and large population. Such issues in international\/global marketing textbooks are often generally, but unhelpfully briefly, addressed under the subject of \u2018adaptation\u2019 or \u2018glocalisation\u2019 strategies. Besides, given the fact that relevant books on global\/international branding (e.g., Bühler, 2008; Cato, 2010; Gregory & Wiechmann, 2001; Van Gelder, 2003) are generally focused on familiar western brands, Temporal\u2019s book draws marketers\u2019 attention to the myriad brands in non-western contexts.

An eight-person research team was assembled at the University of Strathclyde to investigate, support and raise awareness of the key factors affecting successful STEM transition from secondary school to university. The group made up from students and academics was a novel approach and aimed at developing their knowledge of the current Scottish education system whilst developing partnerships with secondary schools in the local Glasgow area.\nSeveral peer discussion groups were conducted as part of the methodology and it was through these that ideas, such as a student elective scheme allowing university students to enter schools and run project based learning workshops, could benefit the transition strategy for young people to enter the STEM based disciplines at university. The outlined proposals, when implemented, have the possibility of negating the previous inconsistency of previous attempts to address the problem of successful STEM transition. Four key project deliverables were identified that had the potential to develop the strategy necessary to encourage and develop school pupils into the STEM subject areas and with the\nhelp of staff

We report on an assessor-blinded RCT of a treatment intervention in 82 obese 10- to 14-year-olds (mean age 12.4, SD 1.2 years), randomised to a good practice treatment or primary care control group over 6 months. The good practice intervention was intended as relatively low intensity (6 hours contact over 24 weeks, group-based), aiming to change sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet. The primary outcome was a change in body mass index (BMI) Z score; other outcomes were changes in waist circumference and blood pressure.  The retention of subjects to follow up was acceptable (n\u2009=\u200931 from the intervention group, and n\u2009=\u200932 from the control group), but engagement with both the intervention and control treatment was poor. Treatment had no significant effect on BMI Z score relative to control, and no other significant benefits to intervention were observed.  The trial was feasible, but highlights the need to engage obese adolescents and their families in the interventions being trialled. The trial should inform the development of future adolescent obesity treatment trials in the Gulf States with the incorporation of qualitative assessment in future intervention trials.","title":"National Adolescent Treatment Trial for Obesity in Kuwait (NATTO): project design and results of a randomised controlled trial of a good practice approach to treatment of adolescent obesity in Kuwait","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"591","weight":0.8667,"docData":{"date":"10\/07\/19","money":"217","wordCount":"30","university":"C","abstract":"This document provides an overview of key findings from the evaluation of the work of the CELCIS national Permanence and Care Team (PaCT) from its inception in September 2012 to September 2014.

A retrospective prescribing database cohort was obtained from 44 general practitioner surgeries in National Health Service Forth Valley Scotland. Patients with physician-diagnosed asthma or COPD who received maintenance therapy between January 2008 and December 2009 were included. Five classes of therapy were assessed: inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, combination therapy inhalers, theophyllines and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Adherence was calculated using the medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the time to discontinuation (TTD) over 1 year. Two step-wise logistic regressions were performed to assess the contribution of diagnosis to adherence\/persistence.  A total of 13,322 patients were included in the analysis: 10,521 patients with asthma and 2801 patients with COPD. 25.2% of medication episodes for asthma and 45.6% of medication episodes for COPD were classified as having an adequate medication supply (MPR of 80-120%). The overall median TTD was 92 days (IQR, interquartile range: 50-186 days) for patients with asthma and 116 days (IQR: 58-259 days, comparison p < 0.001) for patients with COPD. Patients with COPD were found to be more likely to achieve an MPR of at least 80% (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15-1.40), but had a similar likelihood of persistence at 1 year to patients with asthma.  Adherence and persistence with respiratory therapies in the UK is relatively low. There is suggestion that patients with COPD may display more adherent behaviours than patients with asthma.","title":"A comparison of medication adherence\/persistence for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the United Kingdom","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"67","weight":0.8445,"docData":{"date":"02\/08\/15","money":"725","wordCount":"90","university":"A","abstract":"To examine the factor structure of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) with Australian adolescents with and without Attention\u2013Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

The remaining 95 were non ADHD Community Comparisons. Results: Analyses supported a three-factor model, with a reduced item pool, which combined the Harm Avoidance and Separation Anxiety scales together. This model was invariant across younger and older participants, and across boys and girls. The model was largely invariant across ADHD and non-ADHD groups. The ADHD group had significantly higher Physical Symptom factor scores than the non-ADHD group. The MASC is useful for assessing anxiety in adolescents with and without ADHD but items reflecting the Harm Avoidance and Separation Anxiety scales may need revising.","title":"The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children: a further validation with Australian adolescents with and without ADHD","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"683","weight":0.8282,"docData":{"date":"07\/08\/16","money":"902","wordCount":"128","university":"D","abstract":"Background: The faecal calprotectin (FC) test is a non-invasive marker for gastrointestinal inflammation.

Methods: A single centre prospective study was undertaken in Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission attending for routine review. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the primary endpoint of clinical relapse by 12 months, based on FC at baseline, was calculated.

The area under the ROC curve to predict relapse using FC was 77.4 An optimal cutoff FC value of 240?g\/g to predict relapse of quiescent Crohn's had sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 74.4 Negative predictive value was 96.8% and positive predictive value was 27.6 FC?240mug\/g was associated with likelihood of relapse 5.7 (95% CI 1.9-17.3) times higher within 2.3 years than lower values (p=0.002). Conclusions: In this prospective dataset, FC appears to be a useful, non-invasive tool to help identify quiescent Crohn's disease patients at a low risk of relapse over the ensuing 12 months. FC of 240?g\/g was the optimal cutoff in this cohort.","title":"A prospective evaluation of the predictive value of faecal calprotectin in quiescent Crohn's disease","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"249","weight":0.8245,"docData":{"date":"19\/11\/16","money":"780","wordCount":"188","university":"C","abstract":"Background: Depression is common in patients with cardiometabolic diseases but little is known about the relationship, if any, between cardiovascular risk factor values and depressive symptoms in patients with these conditions. The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear \"J-shaped\" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg\/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol\/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a \"J-shaped\" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.","title":"Revisiting the J shaped curve, exploring the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease: findings from a large cross-sectional study","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"583","weight":0.8236,"docData":{"date":"15\/03\/17","money":"409","wordCount":"238","university":"C","abstract":"Objective: To evaluate the impact of a diet and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) on weight change in people with a body mass index >25 weight (kg)\/height (m)2 at increased risk of colorectal cancer and other obesity related comorbidities. Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Four Scottish National Health Service health boards. Participants 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test result, as part of the national bowel screening programme, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomised to intervention and 166 to control. Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight. Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Differences between groups were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. Conclusions: Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening programme, offering considerable potential for risk reduction of disease in older adults.","title":"The impact of a bodyweight and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening programme: randomised controlled trial","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"624","weight":0.8136,"docData":{"date":"09\/03\/15","money":"938","wordCount":"118","university":"E","abstract":"To test for cross-sectional (at age 11) and longitudinal associations between objectively measured free-living physical activity (PA) and academic attainment in adolescents.

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention.

The present study aimed to address these limitations and examine longitudinal associations between obesity in adolescence and academic attainment. Associations between weight status at 11 years old and academic attainment assessed by national tests at 11, 13 and 16 years were examined in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Healthy weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) Z-score <1.04; overweight as BMI Z-score 1.04-1.63; obesity as BMI Z-score 1.64.  Data from 5966 participants with objectively measured weight status were examined: 71.4% were healthy weight (1935 males; 2325 females), 13.3% overweight (372 males; 420 females) and 15.3% obese (448 males; 466 females).  Girls obese at 11 years had lower academic attainment at 11, 13 and 16 years compared with those of a healthy weight, even after controlling for a wide range of confounders. Associations between obesity and academic attainment were less clear in boys. The potential mediating effects of depressive symptoms, intelligence quotient (IQ) and age of menarche in girls were explored, but when confounders were included, there was no strong evidence for mediation.  For girls, obesity in adolescence has a detrimental impact on academic attainment 5 years later. Mental health, IQ and age of menarche did not mediate this relationship, suggesting that further work is required to understand the underlying mechanisms.

There is a need to develop effective reading comprehension interventions that fit easily into the school curriculum that can benefit all pupils. A feasibility study of reading comprehension strategies with good evidence of efficacy was undertaken in three mainstream primary schools in an area of social deprivation in west central Scotland, to decide whether further investigation of this intervention was warranted.\nAims were to measure comprehension of spoken language and reading via standardised assessments towards the beginning of the school year (T1) in mainstream primary school classrooms within an area of social deprivation; to have teachers introduce previously-validated text comprehension strategies, and to measure change in reading comprehension outcome measures towards the end of the year (T2). \nA pre- and post-intervention cohort design was used. Reading comprehension strategies were introduced to staff in participating schools and used throughout the school year as part of on-going reading instruction.

The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home.

There were three aims; to determine if putting actions are scaled by manipulating swing amplitude as predicted by Craig et al. (2000), to establish the test-retest reliability of the Craig et al. model, and to evaluate whether elite golfers changed their putting scaling strategies when fatigued. Putting actions were recorded at baseline (time 1) and 6 months later (time 2) and after walking at 70% of maximum heart rate for 1 h (time 3). Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al. (2000) model had good test-retest reliability. Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact. These motor control changes in performance when fatigued were evident in successful putts indicating that even when these elite golfers were able to achieve the goal of holing the putt, moderate levels of fatigue were influencing the consistency of their performance. Theoretical implications for the Craig et al. (2000) model and practical implications for elite golfers are discussed.","title":"Motor control strategies and the effects of fatigue on golf putting performance","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"553","weight":0.4676,"docData":{"date":"04\/08\/19","money":"801","wordCount":"77","university":"A","abstract":"In September 2012, the Scottish Government hosted a Women's Employment Summit in Edinburgh.

The PCEPS consists of 15 items with two subscales: Person Centred Process, and Experiential Process. Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were counsellors in training. Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred\u2019, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 12-item facilitative relationship factor that cuts across Person-centred and Experiential subscales (alpha: .98), and a nonfacilitative directiveness factor (3 items, alpha: .89).

How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.\nThe study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011\u201312, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"791","weight":0.317,"docData":{"date":"15\/02\/15","money":"772","wordCount":"142","university":"C","abstract":"In 2008, a national human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation programme began in Scotland for 12\u201313 year old females with a three-year catch-up campaign for those under the age of 18. Since 2008, three-dose uptake of bivalent vaccine in the routine cohort aged 12\u201313 has exceeded 90% annually, while in the catch-up cohort overall uptake is 66%.  To monitor the impact of HPV immunisation, a programme of national surveillance was established (pre and post introduction) which included yearly sampling and HPV genotyping of women attending for cervical screening at age 20. By linking individual vaccination, screening and HPV testing records, we aim to determine the impact of the immunisation programme on circulating type-specific HPV infection particularly for four outcomes: (i) the vaccine types HPV 16 or 18 (ii) types considered to be associated with cross-protection: HPV 31, 33 or 45; (iii) all other high-risk types and (iv) any HPV.  From a total of 4679 samples tested, we demonstrate that three doses (n=1100) of bivalent vaccine are associated with a significant reduction in prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 from 29.8% (95% confidence interval 28.3, 31.3%) to 13.6% (95% confidence interval 11.7, 15.8%). The data also suggest cross-protection against HPV 31, 33 and 45. HPV 51 and 56 emerged as the most prevalent (10.5% and 9.6%, respectively) non-vaccine high-risk types in those vaccinated, but at lower rates than HPV 16 (25.9%) in those unvaccinated.  This data demonstrate the positive impact of bivalent vaccination on the prevalence of HPV 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 in the target population and is encouraging for countries which have achieved high-vaccine uptake.","title":"Introduction and sustained high coverage of the HPV bivalent vaccine leads to a reduction in prevalence of HPV 16\/18 and closely related HPV types","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"771","weight":0.3016,"docData":{"date":"17\/11\/18","money":"650","wordCount":"63","university":"C","abstract":"The epidemiology of ano-genitals cancers is under going substantial change.

The long-term focus for Tdh has been on protecting children, and successive teams have sought to ground their work in the experiences of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. Working closely with front-line professionals involved in providing care and protection to these children has been fundamental. While contributing to the development of the CPS, Tdh has also been careful to take account of the large, culturally distinct minority groups that exist in Albania.

CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"747","weight":0.2101,"docData":{"date":"13\/01\/19","money":"946","wordCount":"119","university":"C","abstract":"New media are commonplace in children\u2019s lives. Speech and language therapists (SLTs), educational psychologists and teachers are sometimes called upon by caregivers to provide advice on whether or how children and young people with language impairments should be encouraged to use these media. This article aims to illuminate some of the key issues and to review the implications of different types of advice that practitioners might provide. Four broad strategies are considered: Prohibition, Laissez-faire, Restriction, and Constructive use. Possible consequences of each strategy are outlined and it is proposed that Constructive use should be the strategy of choice. Reasons in favour of a constructive orientation include the benefits of joint engagement, enjoyment, cognitive and perceptual challenges and social motivation; effective uses can support educational attainment in young people with language impairments. Some areas where children and young people with language impairments need support with new media are noted. Decisions that we make about whether to constrain or support uses of new media have direct implications for the quality of young people\u2019s lives and futures. SLTs, educational psychologists and teachers have important roles to play in the development of better-informed policies and strategies concerning language impaired youngsters and digital media.","title":"Turn off or tune in?

The Lab took place in June 2015.\n\nThe Experience Lab aimed to co-create scenarios in which digital interventions could be used as motivation to increase the level of physical activity for dads, as a means of reducing the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. We looked at how the daily life of the men taking part had changed when they became a dad, how these changes possibly influenced their level of physical activity, and what would motivate them to become more active.\n\nThe Lab provided a safe and creative environment through which the Lab team helped participants (\u201Cexperienced dads\u201D) to feel comfortable to share stories, reflect on their lives and explore their motivations. The information gathered was then used to co-create possible scenarios for ways in which digital interventions could motivate the participants to enjoy an active everyday life.\n\nA series of activities including a physical work out, fireplace story sharing, mapping and a co-creation session were designed to gain insights into what appropriate support for dads in maintaining an active lifestyle would look like.\n\nThe outputs from the Lab included audio, photos, videos and field notes which were analysed for emerging themes.\n\nThe Experience Lab showed that a key to maintaining an active lifestyle is balancing a man\u2019s time as a dad and his personal time, which was described as very challenging by the participants. Whether you need to sleep, go to the pub, work in the garden or go for a run, it is that time for yourself that most men feel like they must give up once they become a dad. It became apparent that the activities participants engaged in during the Lab day served as a moment to reflect on the balance of their lives. More than the solutions co-created, the greatest value was gained from the activity of reflecting and identifying different stages in their lives with accompanying behavioural changes.\n\nIt should be noted that the Lab involved a small number of participants, but that the intimate setting allowed participants to feel comfortable to share experiences on an emotional level, which made it possible to gather the qualitative insights included in our report.","title":"Boys and their Toys","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"688","weight":0.1886,"docData":{"date":"08\/09\/17","money":"119","wordCount":"122","university":"E","abstract":"Spatial planning and spatial policy continues to be used as a tool to bring about changes in travel behaviour. Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced. This paper uses data collected in 2006 from 280 households in Glasgow and Edinburgh to analyse the relationships between urban form and vehicle miles driven, with an emphasis on those who had recently relocated. Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area. Whether or not such intensification can be enacted against a backdrop of preferences towards suburban, car oriented living is contentious. As such, this study calls into question the use of planning policy as a means to reduce car use in Scottish cities.","title":"The influence of urban form on car travel following residential relocation: a current and retrospective study in Scottish urban areas","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"358","weight":0.1861,"docData":{"date":"17\/09\/16","money":"681","wordCount":"86","university":"D","abstract":"This paper draws on qualitative and quantitative data from a survey of youth justice practitioners' and managers' experience of the implementation and use of movement restriction conditions (MRCs) in Scotland.

Patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to conventional therapy were recruited and given L-NNA intravenously at two different dose levels. Volumetric perfusion CT scans were carried out at 1, 24, 48 & 72 hours post L-NNA. Blood pressures were taken at regular interval for 6 hours after LNNA.

Education for Citizenship, as opposed to Citizenship Education, in Scotland is not a discrete subject; the objective is that citizenship permeates everything that happens throughout school, academically and socially. It is centrally situated alongside children becoming \u2018effective contributors\u2019, \u2018successful learners\u2019 and \u2018confident individuals\u2019. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of Community of Philosophical Inquiry (CoPI) as a pedagogical tool to enhance citizenship attributes in Scottish children in a range of educational settings. In order, first, to get an insight into the teachers\u2019 perspectives on the Education for Citizenship agenda in Scotland, the teachers were asked for their definitions of \u2018citizen\u2019. Similarly, the children were also asked about their notion of \u2018citizen\u2019. The children\u2019s group betrayed a more political understanding of \u2018citizen\u2019 than the teachers. Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as \u2018informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues\u2019. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children\u2019s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI. The article uses contributions from the children to highlight areas of their lives within school and in society beyond school, where\ndoing philosophy has had an impact.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically. We controversially suggest that, in order to engage girls in physical education, we may have to temporarily remove the physical domain of learning (at least for some girls) in order to positively affect their longer term engagement in the subject.","title":"Hiding behind the camera: social learning within the cooperative learning model to engage girls in physical education","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"173","weight":0.1457,"docData":{"date":"14\/02\/19","money":"859","wordCount":"151","university":"A","abstract":"There is strong governmental support within the UK to develop creativity and emphasise the importance of its role in learning and teaching, Sharp (2003) identified issues, gaps and priorities for further research that looked at the impact on children of working with professional artists in terms of their creativity.

In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study conducted with recently migrated Eastern European children and their parents, reporting on their experiences of accessing health services post-migration. Unlike the case of adults, the experiences of newly migrated children have rarely been explored in relation to health services. We pay particular attention to three key areas: (1) migrant families׳ views of health service provision; (2) barriers to health service use; and (3) transnational use of health services. By using a social capital approach, we show how concerns about the Scottish health care practices enacted by migrant parents are adopted by children and are likely to impact on families׳ health beliefs and behaviours. The study highlights the important role of migrants׳ active participation as users of health services. We conclude that appropriate health services need to consider more carefully migrants׳ expectations and complex health care activities, in order to be fully inclusive and patient-centred.","title":"'I think that Polish doctors are better': experiences with and views of health services in Scotland among newly arrived migrant children and their parents","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"49","weight":0.1356,"docData":{"date":"28\/11\/18","money":"914","wordCount":"214","university":"C","abstract":"Generic atypical antipsychotic drugs offer health authorities opportunities for considerable savings. However, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are complex diseases that require tailored treatments. Consequently, generally there have been limited demand-side measures by health authorities to encourage the preferential prescribing of generics. This is unlike the situation with hypertension, hypercholaesterolaemia or acid-related stomach disorders.The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the limited demand-side measures in Western European countries and regions on the subsequent prescribing of risperidone following generics; to utilise the findings to provide future guidance to health authorities; and where possible, to investigate the utilisation of generic versus originator risperidone and the prices for generic risperidone.\n\nPrincipally, this was a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series data of the effect of the various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).\n\nThere was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland. Similarly, the price of generic risperidone varied considerably. In Scotland, generic risperidone was only 16% of pre-patent loss prices versus 72% in Ireland.\n\nConsistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.","title":"Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? findings from across Europe and their implications","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"651","weight":0.1341,"docData":{"date":"31\/08\/15","money":"607","wordCount":"179","university":"D","abstract":"Provision of optimal nutrition in children in critical care is often challenging.

India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7\u201337.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846\u2013$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children. Increasing all immunization rates to 90% (intervention two) averts an additional 22.1 (95% UR, 18.6\u201325.7) deaths and $45,914 (95% UR, $37,909\u2013$53,920) OOP expenditure. Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.","title":"Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"382","weight":0.1112,"docData":{"date":"28\/05\/18","money":"978","wordCount":"27","university":"B","abstract":"Delivered by Jenny Johnstone (University of Newcastle\/Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research);  David Orr (CYCJ); and Mary Munro (University of Strathclyde) at the European Restorative Justice Forum in Belfast, June 2014.","title":"Restorative justice in Scotland: at the crossroads?","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"204","weight":0.1096,"docData":{"date":"05\/04\/18","money":"899","wordCount":"73","university":"E","abstract":"Resveratrol, a natural compound endowed with multiple health-promoting effects, has received much attention given its potential for the treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, metabolic and age-related diseases.

By students being active participants in the project, they will learn more about the Holocaust and recognize the relevance of these testimonies in today\u2019s society. Although some of the survivors have been interviewed about their journeys in fleeing from the Nazi atrocities, for all of the interviewees, this is the first time that they have been asked about their lives once they arrived in the United Kingdom. The interviews have also focused on citizenship and integration into society.

This study reports on the presence of transient EEG based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyse dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronisation in the theta, alpha and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both non-painful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronisation during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.","title":"Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"455","weight":0.0901,"docData":{"date":"15\/01\/15","money":"657","wordCount":"111","university":"A","abstract":"Previous studies have employed generic 3D-multiscale models to predict haemodynamic effects of the hybrid procedure in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

In this article, we argue that exclusive use of aggregate indices can limit state politics research. Using a new dataset with almost 40 years of data on state legislative resources, salary, and session length, we reconsider the validity of using an index to study professionalism across the states. We evaluate the internal consistency of professionalism components over time, the relationship between components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling. We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating multidimensional measures. Scholars should take care to choose the appropriate measure of the concept that best fits the causal relationships under examination.","title":"Should we measure professionalism with an index?

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes. Further concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders are required to fully integrate preoperative assessment within the health-board surgical care pathway. A substantial \u2013 yet unfulfilled \u2013 potential benefit in embedding information technology in routine use within the preoperative clinic would be to improve the reporting of surgical outcomes.","title":"A study of clinical and information management processes in the surgical pre-assessment clinic","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"640","weight":0.0741,"docData":{"date":"18\/03\/19","money":"784","wordCount":"135","university":"A","abstract":"This study aimed to monitor the microbiological effect of cleaning near-patient sites over a 48-hour period with a novel disinfectant, electrolyzed water.

The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.

The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls.

We report association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and HLA types in a cohort of individuals affected by language impairment.  We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed HLA types.  Quantitative association analyses of imputed HLA types suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A1 was associated with a measure of short-term memory (P = 0.004) and A3 with expressive language ability (P = 0.006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B8 and HLA-DQA1*0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0.021, P = 0.034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0.013, P = 0.029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed HLA types indicated that the DR10 allele of HLA-DRB1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0.004, relative risk = 2.575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  These preliminary data provide an intriguing link to those described by previous studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders and suggest a possible role for HLA loci in language disorders.","title":"Associations of HLA alleles with specific language impairment","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"37","weight":0.0345,"docData":{"date":"12\/06\/17","money":"554","wordCount":"87","university":"B","abstract":"I present a datatype-generic treatment of recursive container types whose elements are guaranteed to be stored in increasing order, with the ordering invariant rolled out systematically. Intervals, lists and binary search trees are instances of the generic treatment. On the journey to this treatment, I report a variety of failed experiments and the transferable learning experiences they triggered. I demonstrate that a total element ordering is enough to deliver insertion and flattening algorithms, and show that (with care about the formulation of the types) the implementations remain as usual. Agda's instance arguments and pattern synonyms maximize the proof search done by the typechecker and minimize the appearance of proofs in program text, often eradicating them entirely. Generalizing to indexed recursive container types, invariants such as size and balance can be expressed in addition to ordering. By way of example, I implement insertion and deletion for 2-3 trees, ensuring both order and balance by the discipline of type checking.","title":"How to keep your neighbours in order","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"623","weight":0.0286,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/15","money":"309","wordCount":"105","university":"D","abstract":"This paper examines the origins of the infant mind in its first purposeful movements, evident in utero, and traces their development into complex projects of social meaning-making in the first year of life.  All movements require prospective control, an anticipation of their future effect.  This constitutes the first form of knowledge, knowing ahead of time the effects of a particular self-generated action.  At first, these are basic and simple, but over development they become serially organised into projects requiring greater knowledge of their distal consequences, as they expand in capacity and reach.  This is a transition from brainstem mediated conscious control to more abstract, cortically mediated control.   In social engagement, self-generated acts of expression made with another co-create regular, non-verbal narrative patterns that establish common meaning available for social understanding and sharing intentions.  By tracing development of meaning-making from solo projects in utero to shared narrative projects in early life, we can better appreciate social patterns and their compositions evident in health, disrupted in pathology, and important for development and learning.","title":"On the origins of understanding: from early intentions in utero to shared social projects of common purpose","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"570","weight":0.025,"docData":{"date":"19\/04\/15","money":"724","wordCount":"40","university":"B","abstract":"A novel BODIPY-containing organic small molecule is synthesized and employed as a down-converting layer on a commercial blue light-emitting diode (LED).

To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC\/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.","title":"High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"604","weight":0.0179,"docData":{"date":"18\/02\/17","money":"843","wordCount":"168","university":"E","abstract":"Primary physical education (PPE) is increasingly being recognised for the role it can potentially play in setting a foundation for lifelong engagement in physical activity. However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"239","weight":0.0179,"docData":{"date":"25\/12\/19","money":"387","wordCount":"112","university":"C","abstract":"Recent research in different parts of the UK has pointed to growing acceptance of the mediation process from legal professionals with promises of potential costs savings for end-users. Nonetheless in many jurisdictions take up is low despite positive evidence relating to use and there is scant empirical knowledge about construction lawyers' role in the referral of cases to mediation and sophisticated evidence relative to lawyer and client interaction in the expediting use of the process. This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper. Evidence gleaned in Scotland has significance beyond its borders given the commonality of issues pertaining to mediation growth across all developing jurisdictions and the presence of a dominant adjudication regime which can be seen as a significant inhibiting factor in the use of mediation.","title":"A reflection on construction mediation in Scotland","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"143","weight":0.0114,"docData":{"date":"30\/10\/19","money":"338","wordCount":"88","university":"C","abstract":"This presentation aims to build upon the central themes emerging from our ESRC seminar series on Consumer Vulnerability (2013-2014). These seminars provided a space to critically engage with the notion of consumer vulnerability in two key ways. First, they brought together international speakers from the fields of marketing, consumer research, sociology, social policy, law and medicine to ensure developments in thinking and best practice were shared across academic networks and across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Second, policy and practitioner organisations played a key role in our series, thereby adding a more practical element to discussions. An overarching concern emerging from the seminar series was the nature of the language we use when discussing those experiencing vulnerability, and how this language impacts on the relationship s between individuals and the services they used (both private and non - commercial). In particular, this presentation will consider the issues involved when approaching vulnerability with consumer - focused terminology.","title":"Patient, client, user, consumer?

Conventional, separate mediastinal and pleural tubes are often inefficient at draining thoracic effusions.  Description: We developed a Y-shaped chest tube with split ends that divide within the thoracic cavity, permitting separate intrathoracic placement and requiring a single exit port. In this study, thoracic drainage by the split drain vs. that of separate drains was tested.  Methods: After sternotomy, pericardiotomy, and left pleurotomy, pigs were fitted with separate chest drains (n=10) or a split tube prototype (n=9) with internal openings positioned in the mediastinum and in the costodiaphragmatic recess. Separate series of experiments were conducted to test drainage of D5W or 0.58 M sucrose, an aqueous solution with viscosity approximating that of plasma. One litre of fluid was infused into the thorax, and suction was applied at -20 cm H2O for 30 min.  Results: When D5W was infused, the split drain left a residual volume of 53±99 ml (mean value ± SD) vs. 148 ± 120 for the separate drain (P = 0.007), representing a drainage efficiency (i.e. drained vol\/[drained + residual vol]) of 95 ± 10% vs. 86 ± 12% for the separate drains (P = 0.011). In the second series, the split drain evacuated more 0.58 M sucrose in the first minute (967 ± 129 ml) than the separate drains (680 ± 192 ml, P<0.001). By 30 min, the split drain evacuated a similar volume of sucrose vs. the conventional drain (1089 ± 72 vs. 1056 ± 78 ml; P = 0.5).

Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.\nMaterial and Methods\nTwo embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.\nResults\nStatistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p\u200A=\u200A<0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC\u200A=\u200A0.851). Sensitivity and specificity for tissue identification was 77% and 70% respectively to a resolution of 6 mm2.\nConclusions\nThis cadaveric study has evaluated the ability of our elasticity assessment device to differentiate bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter to a resolution of 6 mm2. The results provide useful data for which to continue to examine the use of elasticity assessment devices for tissue quality assessment with the aim of giving haptic feedback to surgeons performing complex surgery.","title":"Tissue quality assessment using a novel direct elasticity assessment device (the e-finger): a cadaveric study of prostatectomy dissection","authors":"B & H"}},{"docId":"69","weight":0.6843,"docData":{"date":"25\/12\/15","money":"378","wordCount":"114","university":"C","abstract":"The Aschheim\u2013Zondek reaction is generally regarded as the first reliable hormone test for pregnancy and as a major product of the \u2018heroic age\u2019 of reproductive endocrinology.

It was used, less as a yes-or-no test for ordinary pregnancy, than as a versatile diagnostic tool for the early detection of malignant tumours and hormonal deficiencies believed to cause miscarriage.

Although it is known that optimal muscle contraction is achieved when electrical stimulation is applied close to the muscle motor point, AFES studies have used a variety of electrode positions. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the motor points of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.  Low frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. The electrode positions which achieved the strongest muscle contractions were recorded as the motor point positions, with measurements repeated once. For five able bodied participants, assessments were repeated after 18 months, in seated and supine positions.  Intersubject uniformity ranged from 2.8 to 8.8 %. Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of <1.7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (<1.7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3.1 cm.

UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the ataxic, but not the HD groups, presumably due to differences in intelligibility in the samples employed, and not to differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared to habitual and fast speaking rates.  UUV results are consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way.

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect GWs emitted from merging binary black holes (BBH) and recover their parameters with next-generation GW observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.","title":"The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"625","weight":0.6552,"docData":{"date":"25\/10\/17","money":"321","wordCount":"145","university":"B","abstract":"This paper describes the design of, and results from, a calibration system for optical linear displacement- (shadow-) sensors.

Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"622","weight":0.6364,"docData":{"date":"10\/06\/19","money":"420","wordCount":"132","university":"C","abstract":"Objective: The development of motor competence in early childhood substantially contributes to successful engagement in sports and other physical activities.

Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred\u2019, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 12-item facilitative relationship factor that cuts across Person-centred and Experiential subscales (alpha: .98), and a nonfacilitative directiveness factor (3 items, alpha: .89). Conclusions\/Implications: The PCEPS has potential for use in RCT research as well as in counselling training and supervision, but will require further testing and validation.","title":"Person Centred and Experiential Psychotherapy Scale (PCEPS): development and reliability of an adherence\/competence measure for person-centred and experiential psychotherapies","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"215","weight":0.3138,"docData":{"date":"23\/06\/16","money":"497","wordCount":"102","university":"A","abstract":"In recent years a specialist interest has developed worldwide in advanced wound management for difficult to heal chronic wounds. Further progress in advanced wound management will require an improvement in personalized medicine for the patient and in particular an improvement in the availability of diagnostic tests and parameters that fulfil clinical need in wound management decisions. However, without easy to use sensors for nurses and carers these potentially important near-patient diagnostic parameters will not enter clinical diagnostics. This study focuses on a number of metrics for wound condition and wound healing: wound fluid pH, wound moisture, and wound matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzyme activity. To observe these important markers state of the art sensors have been developed that are based on inexpensive sensing technologies that can be integrated within wound dressings. These sensors will enable the wound healing markers to be studied and profiled in clinics which will further enhance the understanding of these markers and their relationship in the complex healing process involved in chronic wound healing.","title":"Development of wearable sensors for tailored patient wound care","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"4","weight":0.2932,"docData":{"date":"12\/02\/16","money":"437","wordCount":"116","university":"E","abstract":"This work reports an investigation on mass transfer by ultrasound agitation during electrodeposition on electrodes separated by a narrow inter-electrode gap. Polarisation experiments were performed to identify the mass transfer limiting current. The limiting current density was used to calculate mass transfer boundary layer thicknesses which were used to develop mass transfer correlations. Experiments were carried out using a cell with parallel copper discs which were positioned at gaps of 1, 0.5 and 0.15cm. The distance between the ultrasonic probe and electrodes was varied between 3 and 1.5cm. The polarisation data showed clear limiting current plateaux when the distance between the electrodes was larger, however significant distortions were observed when the gap was 0.15cm. It was found that lower ultrasound powers of 9-18W\/cm2 provided more effective agitation at narrower electrode gaps than powers exceeding 18W\/cm2. Sherwood correlations showed that in this system, developing turbulence occurs for larger inter-electrode spacing, whereas for narrow electrode gaps fully turbulent correlations were obtained. A 2-D current distribution model showed that potential distortions that were observed in the polarisation data were caused by the close placement of the metallic US probe to the two parallel electrodes.","title":"Effect of ultrasound on mass transfer during electrodeposition for electrodes separated by a narrow gap","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"323","weight":0.2338,"docData":{"date":"22\/02\/15","money":"122","wordCount":"77","university":"C","abstract":"Peek, the Portable Eye Examination Kit, leverages smartphone technology to provide a range of ophthalmic diagnostic tests in low-income settings, thus empowering health workers to diagnose eye diseases and to manage and monitor patients within the community.

For example, P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Using a low cost, screen printed carbon electrode significant changes can be seen in impedance data in the presence of P. aeruginosa after 24 hours. Furthermore, through the use of a normalization technique whereby the phase angle of the impedance (a commonly used parameter) is divided by a starting measurement, it is possible to identify differences between a non-mucoid and mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa. Sensors based upon the techniques described here could be used in a number of healthcare scenarios, where there is a need for low cost, real time detection of P. aeruginosa, such as CF.","title":"Development of a diagnostic device to detect different pseudomonas aeruginosa phenotypes in medically relevant contexts","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"661","weight":0.0865,"docData":{"date":"05\/05\/17","money":"104","wordCount":"162","university":"B","abstract":"This study investigated the strategies used by elite golfers to scale their putting actions to achieve putts of different distances. There were three aims; to determine if putting actions are scaled by manipulating swing amplitude as predicted by Craig et al. (2000), to establish the test-retest reliability of the Craig et al. model, and to evaluate whether elite golfers changed their putting scaling strategies when fatigued. Putting actions were recorded at baseline (time 1) and 6 months later (time 2) and after walking at 70% of maximum heart rate for 1 h (time 3). Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al. (2000) model had good test-retest reliability. Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact. These motor control changes in performance when fatigued were evident in successful putts indicating that even when these elite golfers were able to achieve the goal of holing the putt, moderate levels of fatigue were influencing the consistency of their performance. Theoretical implications for the Craig et al. (2000) model and practical implications for elite golfers are discussed.","title":"Motor control strategies and the effects of fatigue on golf putting performance","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"122","weight":0.058,"docData":{"date":"09\/11\/15","money":"592","wordCount":"69","university":"B","abstract":"Academic Word List (AWL) comprises 570 words, which cover approximately 10% of most academic texts.

The Pfeiffer equation significantly overestimated AEE during SB and underestimated AEE during LPA (P < 0.0125 for both). There was no significant difference between measured and predicted AEEs during MVPA. The Adolph cut-point showed significantly higher accuracy for classifying SB, LPA and MVPA than all others.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically. We controversially suggest that, in order to engage girls in physical education, we may have to temporarily remove the physical domain of learning (at least for some girls) in order to positively affect their longer term engagement in the subject.","title":"Hiding behind the camera: social learning within the cooperative learning model to engage girls in physical education","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"209","weight":0.0213,"docData":{"date":"21\/08\/18","money":"226","wordCount":"94","university":"C","abstract":"This paper investigates the effect of harmonic pollution on the Pulse Sequence Analysis (PSA) pattern. Partial discharge data was captured from electrical trees growing in epoxy resin in the presence of different harmonic regimes. These regimes included 50Hz waveforms polluted with 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 23rd and 25th order harmonics, at varying levels of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and waveshape factor (KS). In this paper, the data has been analyzed using PSA by plotting the external voltage of consecutive PD pulses (un vs un-1). Under pure 50 Hz conditions, four clusters of data points can be identified in the plot and the formation of the clusters is discussed. Further investigation was performed by running the samples to breakdown. The results show that even in the presence of harmonics, an increase of PD occurrence and phase distribution translates into the expected PSA pattern, where clusters of data points merge to form a 45° straight line. Therefore, PSA is relatively immune to the effects of harmonic distortion when considering it only as an indicator of breakdown.","title":"Effect of harmonics on pulse sequence analysis plots from

plants used for the treatment of epilepsy are potentially a valuable source of novel anti-epileptic small molecules. To identify anticonvulsant secondary metabolites, we performed an in vivo, zebrafish-based screen of medicinal plants used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of seizures. Solanum torvum Sw. (Solanaceae) was identified as having significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish larvae with seizures induced by the GABAA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). This finding correlates well with the ethnomedical use of this plant in the Philippines, where a water decoction of S. torvum leaves is used to treat epileptic seizures. HPLC microfractionation of the bioactive crude extract, in combination with the in vivo zebrafish seizure assay, enabled the rapid localization of several bioactive compounds that were partially identified on-line by UHPLC-TOF-MS as steroid glycosides. Targeted isolation of the active constituents from the methanolic extract enabled the complete de novo structure identification of the six main bioactive compounds that were also present in the traditional preparation. To partially mimic the in vivo metabolism of these triterpene glycosides, their common aglycone was generated by acid hydrolysis. The isolated molecules exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish seizure assays. These results underscore the potential of zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation to rapidly identify novel bioactive small molecules of natural origin.","title":"Zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation identifies anticonvulsant steroid glycosides from the Philippine medicinal plant Solanum torvum","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"756","weight":0.9091,"docData":{"date":"18\/08\/16","money":"735","wordCount":"132","university":"B","abstract":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that is formed by the phosphorylation of sphingosine and catalysed by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) or sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2). Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells. These findings indicate that SK1 or SK2 represent potential targets for treating T-ALL.","title":"Assessment of the effect of sphingosine kinase inhibitors on apoptosis,unfolded protein response and autophagy of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells; indications for novel therapeutics","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"118","weight":0.8984,"docData":{"date":"07\/05\/16","money":"503","wordCount":"59","university":"B","abstract":"In this issue of Oncogene, Albinet et al. have demonstrated a critical role of melanoma sphingosine kinase 1, which catalyses formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"197","weight":0.8368,"docData":{"date":"02\/09\/16","money":"992","wordCount":"147","university":"B","abstract":"T Metabolomics and genomics are two complementary platforms for analyzing an organism as they provide information on the phenotype and genotype, respectively.

We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.","title":"Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.7652,"docData":{"date":"23\/02\/15","money":"285","wordCount":"132","university":"C","abstract":"Biased agonism describes a multi-state model of G protein-coupled receptor activation in which each ligand induces a unique structural conformation of the receptor, such that the receptor couples differentially to G proteins and other intracellular proteins.

A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.","title":"UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"513","weight":0.7648,"docData":{"date":"25\/11\/19","money":"347","wordCount":"68","university":"A","abstract":"Propolis is increasingly being explored as a source of biologically active compounds.

These guanine rich sequences are found in different regions of the genome such as telomeres, gene promoters and introns and UTRs of mRNAs. Here a new approach has been developed that utilises surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of the formation of G-quadruplexes. Three G-quadruplex stabilising ligands that each have their own unique SERS response were used in this study and their ability to act as reporters assessed. A SERS response was only obtained from the ligands in the absence of G-quadruplex formation. This resulted in an \"on\/off\" method which was successfully used to qualitatively detect the formation of G-quadruplex using quadruplex-forming sequences such as human telomeric and C-MYC promoter DNAs. The unique SERS spectra of each stabilising ligand offer the potential for use of SERS to study higher order DNA structures. This work shows that the ligands used can act simultaneously as a potential therapeutic stabilising agent and a SERS reporter, therefore allowing the use of SERS as a method of analysis of the formation of G-quadruplex DNAs.","title":"Qualitative SERS analysis of G-quadruplex DNAs using selective stabilising ligands","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"319","weight":0.4658,"docData":{"date":"31\/12\/16","money":"812","wordCount":"146","university":"C","abstract":"Introduction: Gene therapy continues to grow as an important area of research, primarily because of its potential in the treatment of disease. One significant area where there is a need for better understanding is in improving the efficiency of oligonucleotide delivery to the cell and indeed, following delivery, the characterization of the effects on the cell. Methods: In this report, we compare different transfection reagents as delivery vehicles for gold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides, and quantify their relative transfection efficiencies. The inhibitory properties of small interfering RNA (siRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences targeted to human metallothionein hMT-IIa are also quantified in HeLa cells. Techniques used in this study include fluorescence and confocal microscopy, qPCR and Western analysis. Findings: We show that the use of transfection reagents does significantly increase nanoparticle transfection efficiencies. Furthermore, siRNA, ssRNA and ssDNA sequences all have comparable inhibitory properties to ssDNA sequences immobilized onto gold nanoparticles. We also show that functionalized gold nanoparticles can co-localize with autophagosomes and illustrate other factors that can affect data collection and interpretation when performing studies with functionalized nanoparticles. Conclusions: The desired outcome for biological knockdown studies is the efficient reduction of a specific target; which we demonstrate by using ssDNA inhibitory sequences targeted to human metallothionein IIa gene transcripts that result in the knockdown of both the mRNA transcript and the target protein.","title":"Quantification of functionalised gold nanoparticle-targeted knockdown of gene expression in HeLa cells","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"378","weight":0.4514,"docData":{"date":"10\/04\/18","money":"149","wordCount":"144","university":"D","abstract":"Marine invertebrate-associated symbiotic bacteria produce a plethora of novel secondary metabolites which may be structurally unique with interesting pharmacological properties. Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp.

The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"697","weight":0.0852,"docData":{"date":"22\/08\/15","money":"832","wordCount":"94","university":"B","abstract":"Ocean acidification is altering the oceanic carbonate saturation state and threatening the survival of marine calcifying organisms.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"203","weight":0.0755,"docData":{"date":"29\/04\/18","money":"566","wordCount":"159","university":"D","abstract":"Guidance varies regarding the optimal timing of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation.

The cost of energy calculations are based on initial capital costs, the costs of manufacture, installation, operations and maintenance, with particular focus on improved calculations of the annual energy yield with better availability estimations and gearbox loss modelling.","title":"Improved cost energy comparison of permanent magnet generators for large offshore wind turbines","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"408","weight":0.868,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/15","money":"748","wordCount":"106","university":"E","abstract":"Placement of additional control devices along the span of the wind turbine blades is being considered for multi-MW wind turbines to actively alter the local aerodynamic characteristics of the blades. This smart rotor approach can reduce loads on the rotor due to wind field non-uniformity, but also, as presented in this paper, can supplement the pitch control system. Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, pitch actuator travel is reduced by 15 pitch rates by 23 and pitch accelerations by 42 This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades. It is also shown that this may be achieved while also using the smart rotor control for load reduction, though with reduced effectiveness. This shows that smart rotor control can be used to trade pitch actuator requirements as well as load reductions with the cost of installing and maintaining the distributed devices.","title":"Supplementing wind turbine pitch control with a trailing edge flap smart rotor","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"505","weight":0.8572,"docData":{"date":"07\/03\/19","money":"250","wordCount":"63","university":"B","abstract":"This paper uses a scaled down version of the mixed cells modular multilevel converter (MMC) to discuss its modulation and capacitor voltage balancing method, and investigates its AC and DC fault ride-through capability.

The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels, which creates another challenge. Therefore, the issues of voltage matching and DC fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed, where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv\/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels. Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode DC component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a DC to DC transformer where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an AC transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed DC transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability. The DC transformer facilitates DC voltage regulation and near instant isolation of DC faults within its protection zone.

However, it suffers from the low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, only half of the DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system.

On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.","title":"Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"454","weight":0.7639,"docData":{"date":"07\/05\/17","money":"462","wordCount":"72","university":"B","abstract":"An augmentation to conventional wind turbine control is presented and its applicability for providing droop control services to the grid is investigated.

A fault-location estimation algorithm, using the data measured during various system states and is capable of locating the fault types involving one fault resistance (i.e., single-line-to-ground fault or line-to-line fault), is developed and presented. The proposed fault-location technique is shown to have high accuracy; results are presented and compared with the well-established Takagi method and the performance of the algorithm is analyzed and discussed. The proposed technique can reduce or negate limitations associated with conventional single-ended methods and can also estimate other factors associated with the fault (e.g., fault resistance and remote source impedance). In addition, it is a potentially economic solution, since it is relatively straightforward to implement on a standard protection relay hardware platform.

If each wind turbine in a wind farm is forecasted individually, this considerably increases the computational cost, especially for a large wind farm. In this work, a compromise approach is developed where the turbines in the wind farm are clustered and a forecast made for each cluster. Three clustering methods are evaluated: K-means; a self-organizing map (SOM); and spectral clustering (SC). At first, wind turbines in a wind farm are clustered into several groups by identifying similar characteristics of wind speed and output power. Sihouette coefficient and Hopkins statistics indices are adopted to determine the optimal cluster number which is an important parameter in cluster analysis. Next, forecasting models of the selected representative wind turbines for each cluster based on correlation analysis are established separately. A comparative study of the forecast effect is carried to determine the most effective clustering method. Results show that the short-term wind power forecasting on the basis of SOM and SC clustering are effective to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm with better accuracy, respectively, 1.67% and 1.43% than the forecasts using a single wind speed or power to represent the wind farm. Both Hopkins statistics and Sihouette coefficient are effective in choosing the optimal number of clusters. In addition, SOM with its higher forecast accuracy and SC with more efficient calculation when applied into wind power forecasts can provide guidance for the operating and dispatching of wind power.

Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.","title":"Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"787","weight":0.3487,"docData":{"date":"11\/07\/19","money":"943","wordCount":"152","university":"C","abstract":"In this paper a continuous attitude tracking control law is derived directly on the rotation group SO(3). The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally.

The PEF treatment of microalgae, Spirulina, was conducted using 33.3- and 66.7-kV\/cm electric field impulses. The efficiency of the PEF treatment for inactivation of microalgae was assessed by comparison of the growth curves of PEF-treated and untreated samples.

When the field is increased to a magnitude of 66.7 kV\/cm, the growth of microalgae can be stopped by application of 50 impulses.

This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations.

However, this method requires an accurate radiation condition to ensure that the waves propagate away from the ship. Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.","title":"A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"546","weight":0.1429,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/19","money":"485","wordCount":"147","university":"B","abstract":"Recent progress in the field of genetic engineering has opened up the door to novel synthetic biology applications. Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"33","weight":0.1405,"docData":{"date":"17\/02\/16","money":"123","wordCount":"121","university":"A","abstract":"In this paper, the well known stagewise additive modeling using a multiclass exponential (SAMME) boosting algorithm is extended to address problems where there exists a natural order in the targets using a cost-sensitive approach.

This paper presents a preliminary design of a system whose purpose is to stabilize a target\u2019s attitude, using an external module equipped with magnetorquers. The device, initially carried by the chaser spacecraft, is attached to the body of the target satellite. The magnetorquers are then used to detumble the target so that the chaser spacecraft can perform a safe approach prior to capture. A simplified model is used in the initial design phase to optimize the mass of the system and to size the torque rods and power source. Alternative methods for attaching the ASEM to the target from the chaser spacecraft are discussed. In addition a novel magnetic control law suitable for this application is presented. The feasibility of the concept is tested in simulations using a model based on Envisat (assuming that the ASEM is already attached to the target).

It has been shown that Midel 7131 has a higher ac breakdown voltage (27.6 kV) as compared with Diala D oil (26.4 kV) and rapeseed oil (24.6 kV). However, the breakdown voltage of the Diala D oil has the smallest standard deviation (7%) amongst the tested liquids (13% for Midel 7131 and 11% for rapeseed oil). Statistical analysis of the breakdown voltages has been conducted and it has been shown that the ac breakdown voltages can be described by a normal distribution. dc I-V characteristics have been measured and the space charge saturation regime has been observed for all three liquids starting from ~9 kV for positive energisation and ~10 kV for negative energisation in the point-plane topology.

The average path length appears to be more important; the range for the control strategy is wider with the length, but the optimal radius of control also extends.

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind.

This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"186","weight":0.0513,"docData":{"date":"18\/05\/17","money":"574","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"In The Changing Body (Cambridge University Press and NBER, 2011), the authors presented a series of estimates showing the number of calories available for human consumption in England and Wales at various points in time between 1700 and 1909\/13.

In this paper instead, the effect of epistemic uncertainty is modelled with p-boxes on finite sets of values and propagated through the system models to compute the upper and lower expectation on the mass budget.

This paper presents a study and the results on the sintering kinetics of the powder during Micro-FAST for the fabrication of micro-gears (the module is 0.2 and the pitch diameter 1.6 mm) from copper powder. The results showed that the densification of copper powder is related largely to the bulk plastic-deformations of the particles and the melting of the particles at contact interfaces. Particularly, it is revealed that plastic deformations of the copper particles mainly occurred at approximately 340 °C and melting of the particle-interfaces at approximately 640 °C. Differently, in a densification process with a traditional powder sintering method, grain growth and neck growth would, normally, be two dominant mechanisms that achieve the densification of powder.","title":"Sintering kinetics of the powder during fields-activated micro-forming and sintering (Micro-FAST) of copper micro-gears","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"360","weight":0.0438,"docData":{"date":"27\/04\/16","money":"454","wordCount":"137","university":"A","abstract":"Purpose: Explores the franchise relationship in China, focusing on the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict in this developing franchise environment.

Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced. This paper uses data collected in 2006 from 280 households in Glasgow and Edinburgh to analyse the relationships between urban form and vehicle miles driven, with an emphasis on those who had recently relocated. Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area. Whether or not such intensification can be enacted against a backdrop of preferences towards suburban, car oriented living is contentious. As such, this study calls into question the use of planning policy as a means to reduce car use in Scottish cities.","title":"The influence of urban form on car travel following residential relocation: a current and retrospective study in Scottish urban areas","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"488","weight":0.0391,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"198","wordCount":"128","university":"E","abstract":"Many countries around the world are challenged to meet the escalating demand for power often resulting in frequent blackouts. Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.","title":"Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"532","weight":0.0378,"docData":{"date":"21\/06\/19","money":"648","wordCount":"53","university":"D","abstract":"Supply\/Demand Coordination Mechanism (SDCM) refers to any program that encompasses the principle of demand response whilst utilizing the flexibility offered by generators in the system.

A variety of bounded orbits can be determined around each libration point and station-keeping is required to maintain them for multiple revolutions. In this paper, a station-keeping algorithm based on the orbital lifetime expectancy is proposed for so-called quasi-periodic solutions. The method introduced is based on the identification of a manoeuvre maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach. The robustness is proven by the introduction of errors and the evaluation of their impact.","title":"Station-keeping for quasi-periodic orbits","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"8","weight":0.0239,"docData":{"date":"11\/01\/17","money":"194","wordCount":"168","university":"E","abstract":"Many mission scenarios for nanosatellites and CubeSat hardware have already been created that will require autonomous target tracking and rendezvous maneuvers in close proximity to other orbiting objects. While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.","title":"Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"400","weight":0.0187,"docData":{"date":"01\/06\/17","money":"776","wordCount":"107","university":"A","abstract":"Alkyl phosphonic acids (CnPA) are becoming a material of choice for passivation of high-k oxides in organic thin-film transistors with ultra-thin gate dielectrics.

To investigate its importance in P. falciparum, we generated a pepc null mutant (D10Δpepc), which was only achievable when malate, a reduction product of oxaloacetate, was added to the growth medium. D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels. In contrast, metabolism of the carbon skeleton of 13C,15N-U-glutamine was similar in both parasite lines, although the flux was lower in D10Δpepc; it also confirmed the operation of a complete forward TCA cycle in the wild type parasite. Overall, these data confirm the CO2 fixing activity of PEPC and suggest that it provides metabolites essential for TCA cycle anaplerosis and the maintenance of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance. Moreover, these findings imply that PEPC may be an exploitable target for future drug discovery.","title":"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase identified as a key enzyme in erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum carbon metabolism","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"333","weight":0.0159,"docData":{"date":"05\/12\/19","money":"734","wordCount":"63","university":"A","abstract":"Cathodoluminescence (CL) hyperspectral imaging has been performed on GaN nanorods containing a single InGaN quantum disk (SQD) with controlled variations in excitation conditions.

Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.","title":"The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"289","weight":0.0082,"docData":{"date":"21\/07\/15","money":"671","wordCount":"123","university":"C","abstract":"Torrefied biomass is a coal-like fuel that can be burned in biomass boilers or co-fired with coal in co-firing furnaces. To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC\/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately

into the subretinal space of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are designed to electrically stimulate the remaining inner retinal circuitry in response to incident light, thereby recreating a visual signal when photoreceptor function declines or is lost. Preservation of inner retinal circuitry is critical to the fidelity of this transmitted signal to ganglion cells and beyond to higher visual targets. Post-implantation loss of retinal interneurons or excessive glial scarring could diminish and\/or eliminate PVA-evoked signal transmission. As such, assessing the morphology of the inner retina in RP animal models with subretinal PVAs is an important step in defining biocompatibility and predicting success of signal transmission. In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively compare inner retinal morphology after the implantation of a PVA in two RP models: the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) or transgenic S334ter-line 3 (S334ter-3) rhodopsin mutant rat. Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices. In the S334ter-3 rat, we implanted devices at 6-12 weeks of age and again, inner retinal morphology was generally preserved with either PVA design 16-26 weeks post-implantation. Specifically, the length of rod bipolar cells and numbers of cholinergic amacrine cells were maintained along with their characteristic inner plexiform lamination patterns. Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site. Our results indicate that subretinally implanted PVAs are well-tolerated in rodent RP models and that the inner retinal circuitry is preserved, consistent with our published results showing implant-evoked signal transmission.","title":"Inner retinal preservation in rat models of retinal degeneration implanted with subretinal photovoltaic arrays","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"203","weight":0.7359,"docData":{"date":"29\/04\/18","money":"566","wordCount":"159","university":"D","abstract":"Guidance varies regarding the optimal timing of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between uraemia, haemodialysis and early AVF failure.  Immunoblotting and cell proliferation assays were performed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) cells isolated from long saphenous vein samples to evaluate the cells' ability to proliferate when stimulated with uraemic (post-dialysis) and hyperuraemic (pre-dialysis) serum. Clinical data was collected prospectively for 569 consecutive radiocephalic (RCF) and brachiocephalic (BCF) fistulae. The primary outcome was AVF failure at 6 weeks. Dialysis status (haemodialysis (HD); pre-dialysis (Pre-D)), eGFR and serum urea were evaluated to determine if they affected early AVF failure.  Human VSM cells demonstrated increased capacity to proliferate when stimulated with hyperuraemic serum. There was no significant difference in early failure rate of either RCF or BCF depending on dialysis status (pre-D RCF 31.4% (n = 188); pre-D BCF 22.4% (n = 165); HD RCF 29.3% (n = 99); HD BCF 25.9% (n = 116); p = 0.34). There was no difference in mean eGFR between those patients with early AVF failure and those without (11.2+\/-0.2 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 vs. 11.6+\/-0.4 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 ; p = 0.47). Uraemia was associated with early AVF failure (serum urea: 35.0+\/-0.7 mg\/dl vs. 26.6+\/-0.3 mg\/dl (p < 0.001)).  We present the first in vivo evidence of an association between adverse early AVF outcomes and uraemia. This is supported mechanistically by in vitro work demonstrating a pro-mitogenic effect of hyperuraemic serum. We hypothesise that uraemia-driven upregulation of VSM cell proliferation at the site of surgical insult in contributes to higher early AVF failure rates.","title":"Renal function, uraemia and early arteriovenous fistula failure","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"627","weight":0.7223,"docData":{"date":"30\/05\/16","money":"542","wordCount":"90","university":"A","abstract":"The paper reports an extensive study on the regenerating performance of thermally treated glass fibres using two different chemically based treatments routes.

When complications arise, such as aortic stenosis, prognosis can be very poor, leading to death within the first few years. Surgical valve replacement is currently the standard treatment for aortic stenosis. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and function of the native valve is imperative when developing a prosthetic replacement that can withstand the complex demands of the heart. This review focuses on the anatomy, structure and disease of the aortic valve and the implications for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Current complications with TAVR, such as major vascular bleeding, conduction disturbances and patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM), can be overcome by reducing the delivery profile and through the use of more accurate imaging technologies to work towards a fully functional and durable prosthesis.","title":"The aortic valve: structure, complications and implications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"546","weight":0.6463,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/19","money":"485","wordCount":"147","university":"B","abstract":"Recent progress in the field of genetic engineering has opened up the door to novel synthetic biology applications. Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"481","weight":0.6207,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/18","money":"250","wordCount":"58","university":"B","abstract":"Geochemical and isotopic data acquired pre-, syn- And post- CO2 injection at the Pembina Cardium CO2 Monitoring Pilot in Alberta, Canada is presented.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. \nTo address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. \nThe SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper.

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes.

McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.

This paper employs a facile process for the micropatterning of polymer substrates for the manufacture of capacitive transducers. A positive mask of the desired cavity microstructure is deposited onto a polystyrene substrate. The substrate is then exposed to a saturated toluene vapour which is absorbed by the polystyrene causing swelling of the surface except in the areas where the droplets are situated resulting in the formation of micro-cavities at the position of each droplet.

ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions.

GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD).

This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"587","weight":0.0431,"docData":{"date":"25\/03\/15","money":"644","wordCount":"93","university":"C","abstract":"The goal of this work was to investigate formability of AZ31B magnesium alloy during incremental equal channel angular pressing (I-ECAP). Square billets were processed using different routes of I-ECAP at temperatures varying from 125 °C to 250 °C. The billets were obtained from commercially available coarse-grained, hot-extruded rod and fine-grained, hot-rolled plate. A strong influence of the initial microstructure on processing temperature was reported. Fine-grained samples were successfully processed at 200 °C, while coarse-grained ones must have been heated up to 250 °C to avoid fracture. A gradual temperature decrease with subsequent passes allowed successful pressing at 150 °C. Processing using various routes of I-ECAP showed that a billet rotation before the last pass had strong influence on mechanical properties. The results of experiments were plotted on the diagram of allowable processing temperature for AZ31B. It was found that the relation between the minimum temperature in I-ECAP and the initial grain size could be described by a logarithmic equation.","title":"The effect of initial grain size on formability of AZ31B magnesium alloy during I-ECAP","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"75","weight":0.0224,"docData":{"date":"29\/11\/16","money":"532","wordCount":"134","university":"A","abstract":"Nurse scheduling is a critical issue in the management of emergency department. Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G &

Lifetime exposure to ambient UVR was estimated from residential history and Eurosun satellite-based estimations of ground UVR. It was divided in three groups (lower quartile, intermediate quartiles, upper quartile), using the intermediate quartiles as the reference. Early and late AMD was classified from retinal color photographs. Cataract extraction was defined as absence of the natural lens at slit-lamp. After multivariate adjustment, subjects in the upper quartile of lifetime ambient UVR exposure were at increased risk for cataract extraction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.26; P = 0.03) and for early AMD (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.44; P = 0.03), by comparison with subjects in the intermediate quartiles. Subjects in the lower quartile of UVR exposure also were at increased risk for early AMD (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.06-2.69; P = 0.03), by comparison with those with medium exposure. Associations of late AMD with UVR exposure was not statistically significant. This study further confirms the increased risk for cataract extraction in subjects exposed to high ambient UVR. Moreover, it suggests that risk for early AMD is increased in subjects exposed to high UVR, but also to low UVR, by comparison with medium exposures.","title":"Lifetime exposure to ambient ultraviolet radiation and the risk for cataract extraction and age-related macular degeneration: the Alienor Study","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"733","weight":0.8252,"docData":{"date":"01\/10\/15","money":"747","wordCount":"286","university":"A","abstract":"Purpose: Supply chain risk management is still an active area of research that necessitates application of existing risk quantification techniques in established fields for potential application in the research area. This study is focused on bridging the research gap through development of a novel risk management framework that merges the two quantitative techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief networks capture the interdependency between various risk factors while Game theory models the risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders in a supply network. The proposed framework segregates risk drivers, events and consequences and captures their interdependency. Development project of Boeing 787 aircraft was a unique venture in terms of its unconventional supply chain and unproven technology. Instead of the realization of anticipated shorter development time and reduced costs, the project turned out to be a fiasco. A new term \u2018game theoretic risks\u2019 has been coined to acknowledge the risks associated with conflicting incentives of various stakeholders in a supply network. \n\nResearch Approach: This study has focused on a review of the literature for establishing the research gap followed by designing of a novel framework (conceptual model) for quantification and management of supply chain risks. Subsequently, the model has been applied on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft.\n\nFindings and Originality: The developed framework is unique in its design merging two quantitative techniques in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management. Application of the novel framework on a case study of Boeing 787 project revealed its merits in terms of capturing the dynamics of interacting risk factors. Bayesian belief network is a useful modelling technique for risk quantification capturing the interdependency between various risks. Game theoretic modelling provides an opportunity to model the risks associated with conflicting incentives of the stakeholders within a supply network. Game theory based modelling captured the behaviour of suppliers in relation to the uncertainty about cost functions and the final response of Boeing to the delays caused by suppliers. The results clearly manifested importance of the game theoretic risks and as there was no policy to align the incentives of suppliers in Boeing 787 project, there was a major delay causing financial penalty to Boeing. Furthermore, lack of management expertise in Supply Chain Risk Management was a major factor for the higher development cost. It has been proved that lack of information in a supply chain affects the desired objectives of a project. To our best knowledge, such a framework has never been developed and applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management.\n\nResearch Impact: The output of this study will help researchers model the supply chain risks in a more realistic way and stimulate further research in this direction.\n\nPractical Impact: The application of our developed model on a case study reveals its practical impact. Had the Boeing considered the holistic view of the supply chain risks, the project delay and financial loss would not have materialized. Our model can be utilized in supply networks of other industries.","title":"Quantification of supply chain risks: development and application of a novel risk management framework","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"135","weight":0.7697,"docData":{"date":"02\/05\/18","money":"741","wordCount":"165","university":"A","abstract":"Supply chain risk management is an active area of research and there is a research gap of exploring established risk quantification techniques in other fields for application in the context of supply chain management. We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed 'Game theoretic risks' in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing's perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap. Successful application of the framework justifies its potential for further testing in other supply chain risk quantification scenarios.","title":"A novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"206","weight":0.7567,"docData":{"date":"27\/09\/18","money":"746","wordCount":"300","university":"D","abstract":"This paper addresses relationships between the distribution and abundance of zooplankton and its habitat in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. Distributions of ten representative zooplankton taxa, from recent (2000-2009) Continuous Plankton Recorder data, are presented, along with basin-scale patterns of annual sea surface temperature and phytoplankton color.  The distribution patterns represent the manifestation of very different physiological, life history and ecological interactions of each taxon with the North Atlantic habitat characteristics. The paper then focuses on a pan-Atlantic compilation of demographic and life history information for the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, perhaps one of the most ecologically important and certainly the most studied zooplankton species in the North Atlantic. Abundance, dormancy, egg production and mortality in relation to temperature and phytoplankton biomass, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, are analyzed in the context of understanding factors involved in determining the distribution and abundance of C. finmarchicus across its range. Several themes emerge:  (1)  transport of C. finmarchicus is from the south to the north in the northeast Atlantic, but from the north to the south in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses to climate forcing on coastal shelves, , (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east while it occurs after the bloom in many western sites, (3) while the deep basins in the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea are primary sources of C. finmarchicus production,  the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the western North Atlantic shelves, (4) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production responses, (5) differences in functional responses in egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (6) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, and (7) differences in stage-specific mortality rates are related to bathymetry, temperature and potential predators, notably the abundance of congeners Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis, which likely feed on early life stages of C. finmarchicus. Two modeling approaches have previously been used to interpret the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in relation to the North Atlantic habitat. A statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical modeling approach, based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history and implemented by recent developments in coupled physical-life cycle modeling. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. A synthesis of the two modeling approaches to predict North Atlantic zooplankton species shifts, not only for C. finmarchicus, but also for other major taxa, is advocated. While the computational resource requirements and lack of species-specific life history information for physical-biological modeling hinder full application for many zooplankton taxa, use of the approach, where possible, to understand advective influences will provide insight for interpretation of statistical predictions from species distribution models.","title":"The North Atlantic Ocean as habitat for Calanus finmarchicus: environmental factors and life history traits","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"634","weight":0.75,"docData":{"date":"23\/05\/17","money":"933","wordCount":"124","university":"B","abstract":"Estimation of the long-term health effects of air pollution is a challenging task, especially when modeling spatial small-area disease incidence data in an ecological study design. The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"14","weight":0.7426,"docData":{"date":"01\/11\/19","money":"961","wordCount":"101","university":"B","abstract":"Most of the current risk quantification techniques being applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management consider risk factors to be independent.

The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding, whose spatial structure is often characterised by a spatially smooth evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units while other pairs exhibit large step changes. This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify step changes is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy. Results from the England study show that the two diseases have similar spatial patterns in risk, and exhibit a number of common step changes in the unmeasured component of risk between neighbouring local authorities.","title":"An adaptive spatio-temporal smoothing model for estimating trends and step changes in disease risk","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"693","weight":0.649,"docData":{"date":"07\/04\/17","money":"400","wordCount":"94","university":"A","abstract":"We empirically examine the impact of incentive compensation on the riskiness of acquisition decisions before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).

Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives. The decrease in acquisition risk post-SOX cannot be solely attributed to changes in the structure of executive compensation but it additionally stems from the way managers perceive compensation-based incentives in the new regulatory environment.

We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks.

The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies.","title":"Modelling the impact of temperature-induced life history plasticity and mate limitation on the epidemic potential of a marine ectoparasite","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"170","weight":0.5271,"docData":{"date":"10\/05\/18","money":"476","wordCount":"74","university":"B","abstract":"Oriented collapse of columns, large-scale destruction debris and temporary abandonment of the area deduced from an archaeological excavation provide evidence for a major (intensity IX) earthquake in Patras, Greece.

The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans.

At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"417","weight":0.2046,"docData":{"date":"02\/09\/19","money":"657","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"This paper describes spatial and temporal distributions of bone loss in the paralysed limbs of patients  during their first year after spinal cord injury (SCI).

The aim of the study was to use the finite element method to: (i) calculate the mechanical response of the tibia under mechanical load and (ii)  estimate the risk of fracture; comparing between two groups, an able bodied (AB) group and spinal cord injury (SCI) patients group suffering from varying degree of bone loss. The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography. Images were used to develop full three-dimensional models of the tibiae in Mimics (Materialise) and exported into Abaqus (Simulia) for calculation of stress distribution and fracture risk in response to specified loading conditions \u2013 compression, bending and torsion. The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population). The ultimate aim would be to reduce fracture occurrence in these vulnerable groups.","title":"Prediction of risk of fracture in the tibia due to altered bone mineral density distribution resulting from disuse: a finite element study","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"768","weight":0.0991,"docData":{"date":"28\/08\/17","money":"396","wordCount":"101","university":"E","abstract":"This article locates Indian Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) within the global supply chains of business services delivery and an international division of service labour.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes tetA and tetB in almost all slaughterhouse zones. Sulfonamide resistance genes were largely distributed, while beta-lactam resistance genes were less predominant. Statistical analysis revealed that resistant bacteria, in most cases, were spread by the same route in almost all slaughterhouse zones, except for tetB, blaCTX and blaTEM genes, which occurred in few zones as isolated 'hot spots'. The sum of all analyzed ARG indicated that slaughterhouse surfaces and end products act as reservoirs of ARG, mainly tet genes, which were more prevalent in slaughtering room (SR), cutting room (CR) and commercial meat products (MP). Resistance gene patterns suggest they were disseminated throughout slaughterhouse zones being also detected in commercial meat products, with significant correlations between different sampling zones\/end products and total resistance in SR, CR and white room (WR) zones, and also refrigerator 4 (F4) and MP were observed.

After six months of incubation at 750≈ atm pCO 2, reduced carbonic anhydrase protein activity and shell growth occurs in M. edulis. Beyond that, at 1000≈ atm pCO 2, biomineralisation continued but with compensated metabolism of proteins and increased calcite growth.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"150","weight":0.0266,"docData":{"date":"04\/04\/15","money":"160","wordCount":"113","university":"B","abstract":"This article presents comparisons among the five ground-motion models described in other articles within this special issue, in terms of data selection criteria, characteristics of the models and predicted peak ground and response spectral accelerations.

As a result of the differing data selection criteria and derivation techniques the predicted median ground motions show considerable differences (up to a factor of two for certain scenarios), particularly for magnitudes and distances close to or beyond the range of the available observations. The predicted influence of style-of-faulting shows much variation among models whereas site amplification factors are more similar, with peak amplification at around 1s.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

resistance (AR) is often rooted in inappropriate antibiotic use, but poor water quality and inadequate sanitation exacerbate the problem, especially in emerging countries. An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by blaNDM-1 genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and blaNDM-1 genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about blaNDM-1 levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May\/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG) and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1 levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 ± 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 ± 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg-1)) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were very low across all sites (2.1 ± 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1)) in February in the Upper Ganges and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1 levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February and blaNDM-1 levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r=0.61; p=0.007). Given waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar; data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible \"hot spots\" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.","title":"Increased waterborne blaNDM-1 resistance gene abundances associated with seasonal human pilgrimages to the Upper Ganges River","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"26","weight":0.8142,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/19","money":"228","wordCount":"156","university":"D","abstract":"The distribution and quantification of tetracycline, sulfonamide and beta-lactam\nresistance genes were assessed in slaughterhouse zones throughout meat chain\nproduction and the meat products; this study represents the first to report quantitatively monitor antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in goat and lamb slaughterhouse using a culture independent approach, since most studies focused on individual bacterial species and their specific resistance types. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes tetA and tetB in almost all slaughterhouse zones. Sulfonamide resistance genes were largely distributed, while beta-lactam resistance genes were less predominant. Statistical analysis revealed that resistant bacteria, in most cases, were spread by the same route in almost all slaughterhouse zones, except for tetB, blaCTX and blaTEM genes, which occurred in few zones as isolated 'hot spots'. The sum of all analyzed ARG indicated that slaughterhouse surfaces and end products act as reservoirs of ARG, mainly tet genes, which were more prevalent in slaughtering room (SR), cutting room (CR) and commercial meat products (MP). Resistance gene patterns suggest they were disseminated throughout slaughterhouse zones being also detected in commercial meat products, with significant correlations between different sampling zones\/end products and total resistance in SR, CR and white room (WR) zones, and also refrigerator 4 (F4) and MP were observed. Strategically controlling key zones in slaughterhouse (SR, CR and WR) by adequate disinfection methods could strategically reduce the risks of ARG transmission and minimize the issues of food safety and environment contamination.","title":"Diversity, distribution and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in goat and lamb slaughterhouse surfaces and meat products","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"746","weight":0.8125,"docData":{"date":"09\/08\/15","money":"872","wordCount":"112","university":"B","abstract":"Biochar has been proposed as a tool to enhance phytostabilisation of contaminated soils but little data are available to illustrate the direct effect on roots in contaminated soils.

Copper uptake to plants and ammonium sulphate extractable copper was significantly less in the biochar amended soils. Arsenic uptake and extractability varied with type of biochar used but was not considered to be the limiting factor affecting root and shoot development.

As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ\/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J\/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.","title":"Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"760","weight":0.7917,"docData":{"date":"20\/05\/15","money":"895","wordCount":"144","university":"A","abstract":"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders in which language is affected.

We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed HLA types.  Quantitative association analyses of imputed HLA types suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A1 was associated with a measure of short-term memory (P = 0.004) and A3 with expressive language ability (P = 0.006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B8 and HLA-DQA1*0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0.021, P = 0.034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0.013, P = 0.029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed HLA types indicated that the DR10 allele of HLA-DRB1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0.004, relative risk = 2.575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical extraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques provided direct evidence that Tc(VII) was reduced and incorporated into the magnetite structure. Subsequent air oxidation of the magnetite particles for up to 152 days resulted in only limited remobilization of the incorporated Tc(IV).

On reoxidation in air, the incorporated Tc(IV) was recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution with less than 40% remobilization to solution despite significant oxidation of the magnetite to maghemite\/goethite: All solid associated Tc remained as Tc(IV). The results of this study provide the first direct evidence for significant Tc(IV) incorporation into the magnetite structure and confirm that magnetite incorporated Tc(IV) is recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution.

GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD). The kidneys showed early enhancement also, particularly in the renal pelvis, suggesting renal elimination. Imaging of the head with GC-DTPA-Gd allowed detailed anatomical identification of specific blood vessels in particular with the high MW CA agent. Sequential, high-resolution, isotropic imaging of established A431 xenograft flank tumours with DTPA-Gd and GC-DTPA-Gd demonstrated that the initial distribution of the contrast agents was well correlated with blood vessels and supply. In contrast, subsequent tissue transport was primarily by diffusion and limited by CA molecular weight. The data also highlight the role of heterogeneity in CA distribution which was more prominent for the high MW agent. Precise control of glycol chitosan (GC) polymer chemistry facilitates synthesis of a family of Gd-based MRI contrast agents of tuneable MW but otherwise identical physicochemical properties.

India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7\u201337.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846\u2013$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children.

Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.","title":"Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"142","weight":0.6038,"docData":{"date":"02\/03\/18","money":"107","wordCount":"159","university":"B","abstract":"The favored pathway for disposal of higher activity radioactive wastes is via deep geological disposal. Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1.5-1.8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20-60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate)-type crystallographic structure.

To demonstrate the use of these universal tags for the multimodal optical imaging of biological specimens, confocal Raman and fluorescence maps of stained immune cells following nanoparticle uptake were acquired at several excitation wavelengths and compared with dark-field images. The ability to colocalize and track individual\noptically encoded nanoparticles across a wide range of wavelengths simultaneously will enable the use of SERS alongside other imaging techniques for the real-time monitoring of cell-nanoparticle interactions.","title":"Universal surface-enhanced Raman tags: individual nanorods for measurements from the visible to the infrared (514 \u2013 1064 nm)","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"717","weight":0.4229,"docData":{"date":"19\/08\/19","money":"351","wordCount":"149","university":"B","abstract":"Production of soluble (instant) coffee powders typically involves extraction of roasted coffee by water followed by evaporation in order to concentrate extracts before spray or freeze drying to produce dry coffee powder. In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.","title":"Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"356","weight":0.3981,"docData":{"date":"08\/01\/16","money":"857","wordCount":"103","university":"B","abstract":"Objective\n\nAmniotic membrane (AM) is used to manage various debilitated ocular surface conditions. The impact of oxidative stress and free radicals on the ocular surface is increasingly being recognized. Hyaluronic acid (HA) has anti-inflammatory properties and is abundantly present in AM.

Methods: In this report, we compare different transfection reagents as delivery vehicles for gold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides, and quantify their relative transfection efficiencies. The inhibitory properties of small interfering RNA (siRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences targeted to human metallothionein hMT-IIa are also quantified in HeLa cells.

Findings: We show that the use of transfection reagents does significantly increase nanoparticle transfection efficiencies. Furthermore, siRNA, ssRNA and ssDNA sequences all have comparable inhibitory properties to ssDNA sequences immobilized onto gold nanoparticles. We also show that functionalized gold nanoparticles can co-localize with autophagosomes and illustrate other factors that can affect data collection and interpretation when performing studies with functionalized nanoparticles. Conclusions: The desired outcome for biological knockdown studies is the efficient reduction of a specific target; which we demonstrate by using ssDNA inhibitory sequences targeted to human metallothionein IIa gene transcripts that result in the knockdown of both the mRNA transcript and the target protein.","title":"Quantification of functionalised gold nanoparticle-targeted knockdown of gene expression in HeLa cells","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"520","weight":0.3098,"docData":{"date":"26\/08\/18","money":"339","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"We have a limited understanding of the consequences of variations in microbial biodiversity on ocean ecosystem functioning and global biogeochemical cycles. A core process is macronutrient uptake by microorganisms, as the uptake of nutrients controls ocean CO2 fixation rates in many regions. Here, we ask whether variations in ocean phytoplankton biodiversity lead to novel functional relationships between environmental variability and phosphate (Pi) uptake. We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans. Thus, it demonstrates that microbial biodiversity, beyond cell size, is important for understanding the global cycling of nutrients.","title":"Impact of ocean phytoplankton diversity on phosphate uptake","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"769","weight":0.25,"docData":{"date":"27\/04\/17","money":"679","wordCount":"76","university":"A","abstract":"This paper focuses on water governance in the aftermath of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD or Rio+20).

The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces\/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","title":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose\u2013response models as a case study","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"588","weight":0.0984,"docData":{"date":"15\/07\/17","money":"279","wordCount":"183","university":"E","abstract":"It has been reported that HILIC column chemistry has a great effect on the number of detected metabolites in LC-HRMS-based untargeted metabolite profiling studies.

As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column.

Besides column chemistry, the pH of the mobile phase plays a key role in not only determining the retention mechanisms of solutes but also the output of the LC-HRMS data processing. Fast evaporation of ammonium carbonate produced less ion suppression in ESI source and consequently improved the detectability of the metabolites in low abundance in comparison with other ammonium salts.

T and S were therefore spectrophotometrically measured throughout the visible, near, and short wavelength infrared spectral region (400 to ∼2700 nm). Additionally, they were derived from more precise measurements with a point-source integrating-cavity absorption meter (PSICAM) for 400 to 700 nm. When combined with earlier measurements from the literature in the range of 2600 - 14000 nm (wavenumber: 3800 - 700 cm-1), the coefficients are provided for 400 to 14000 nm (wavenumber: 25000 to 700 cm-1).","title":"Temperature and salinity correction coefficients for light absorption by water in the visible to infrared spectral region","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"237","weight":0.0655,"docData":{"date":"11\/12\/17","money":"957","wordCount":"107","university":"B","abstract":"The crystalline nutritional supplement alpha-lipoic acid degrades rapidly on exposure to temperatures above its melting point 65 degrees C and to light.

Previous work demonstrated this process to be highly effective across a wide range of contaminants and soil conditions at the bench scale. In this work, a suite of 12 experiments explored the effectiveness of the process as operating scale was increased 1000-fold from the bench (0.003 m3 ) to intermediate (0.3 m3 ) and pilot field-scale (3 m3 ) with coal tar and petrochemical NAPLs. As scale increased, remediation efficiency of 97\u201399.95% was maintained. Smoul- dering propagation velocities of 0.6\u201314 × 10−5 m\/s at Darcy air fluxes of 1.54\u20139.15 cm\/s were consistent with observations in previous bench studies, as was the dependence on air flux. The pilot field-scale experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000mg\/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with increasing scale. Once the threshold was exceeded, basic process characteristics of average peak temperature, destructive efficiency, and treatment velocity were relatively independent of scale.","title":"Volumetric scale-up of smouldering remediation of contaminated materials","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"276","weight":0.0616,"docData":{"date":"13\/10\/16","money":"647","wordCount":"65","university":"A","abstract":"Synchronized, independently tunable and focused μJ-class laser pulses are used to release multiple electron populations via photo-ionization inside an electron-beam driven plasma wave.

The adhesion of proteins at liquid interfaces is important in many biological processes and in a number of materials applications of biomolecules. While the reduced dimensions of these particles make experimental investigation challenging, molecular simulations provide a natural means for the study of these systems.

Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm\/h1\/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm\/h1\/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg\/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.","title":"The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"453","weight":0.0428,"docData":{"date":"11\/02\/18","money":"768","wordCount":"117","university":"A","abstract":"High-throughput mass spectrometric (HT-MS) study is the method of choice for monitoring global changes in proteome.

Surprisingly a striking number of HT- MS\/MS derived events (1461\/5947 sites or 24.6%) are present in the disallowed region of conformation. By considering protein dynamics, autophosphorylation events and\/or the sequence specificity of kinases, 13.8% of these phosphosites can be moved to the allowed region of conformation. We also demonstrate that rSASA values can be used to increase the confidence of identification of phosphorylation sites within an ambiguous MS dataset.\nWhile MS is a stand-alone technique for the identification of vast majority of phosphorylation events, identifications within disallowed region of conformation will benefit from techniques that independently probe for phosphorylation and protein dynamics.

We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.","title":"Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"47","weight":0.0397,"docData":{"date":"12\/12\/16","money":"441","wordCount":"126","university":"A","abstract":"The possibility of using genes as medicines to treat brain diseases is currently limited by the lack of safe and efficacious delivery systems able to cross the blood-brain barrier, thus resulting in a failure to reach the brain after intravenous administration. On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments. These results suggest that transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer is a highly promising gene delivery system to the brain.","title":"Transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer for targeted gene delivery to the brain","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"217","weight":0.0395,"docData":{"date":"05\/12\/16","money":"195","wordCount":"76","university":"B","abstract":"A new source of radiation can be created with a laser pulse of intensity 1023W\/cm2 interacting with a slightly overdense plasma.

This paper explores the challenges involved in scheduling flexible demand according to objectives in two: the power system and household heat domains. The context is the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions project on the Shetland Islands, UK, where Active Network Management is being used to schedule flexible electric storage and immersion heaters. The study highlights that simplifications and assumptions in both domains must be coordinated to understand the overall effectiveness of a scheme. In the case study, customer facing objectives such as home comfort levels are prioritised over the power system objective of reducing fossil fuel generation. Power system operation aggregates houses into a small number of groups to allow practical scheduling. Modelling results show that this prioritisation and aggregation achieves a reduction in fossil fuel generation of 0.71GWh; 65% of that achieved if customer facing objectives are not prioritised.","title":"Competing objectives in domestic demand side management: learning from the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions projects","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"35","weight":0.8,"docData":{"date":"11\/05\/16","money":"521","wordCount":"145","university":"A","abstract":"The location of the Isles of Lewis and Harris, off the west coast of mainland Scotland, is favourable for the generation of renewable electricity from both the wind and ocean waves. However the islands\u2019 position on the UK electrical grid\u2019s periphery, with restricted local network capacity and only a limited connection to \nthe mainland, makes it more challenging to capitalise on this advantage. This study sought to explore the relationship between the local wind and wave resources and consider how they track the islands\u2019 indigenous demand for electricity. This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand \ndata gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional \ngeneration available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from \nwind and wave sources.","title":"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"443","weight":0.7715,"docData":{"date":"09\/03\/19","money":"856","wordCount":"105","university":"D","abstract":"The objective of the Capacity to Customers (C2C) project, an Ofgem Low Carbon Network Fund project led by Electricity North West Limited (ENWL) in conjunction with several industrial and academic partners, is to test a combination of new automation technology, non-conventional network operational practices (i.e., increased network interconnection), and commercial demand-side response (DSR) contracts.

This study evaluated exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) provision practices and explored predictors of energy intake and delay of EN advancement in critically ill children. Data on intake and EN practices were collected on a daily basis and compared against predefined targets and dietary reference values in a paediatric intensive care unit. Factors associated with intake and advancement of EN were explored. Data were collected from 130 patients and 887 nutritional support days (NSDs). Delay to initiate EN was longer in patients from both the General Surgical and congenital heart defect (CHD) Surgical groups [Median (IQR); CHD Surgical group: 20.3 (16.4) vs General Surgical group: 11.4 (53.5) vs Medical group: 6.5 (10.9) hours; p ≤ 0.001].

A lower proportion of fluids was delivered as EN per patient (45% vs 73%) or per NSD (56% vs 73%) in those from the CHD Surgical group compared with those with medical conditions. Protein and energy requirements were achieved in 38% and 33% of the NSDs. In a substantial proportion of NSDs, minimum micronutrient recommendations were not met particularly in those patients from the CHD Surgical group. A higher delivery of fluid requirements (p < 0.05) and a greater proportion of these delivered as EN (p < 0.001) were associated with median energy intake during stay and delay of EN advancement. Fasting (31%), fluid restriction (39%) for clinical reasons, procedures requiring feed cessation and establishing EN (22%) were the most common reasons why target energy requirements were not met. Provision of optimal EN support remains challenging and varies during hospitalisation and among patients.

Domestic loads, likely to form significant proportions of the loads on islanded power systems such as those in remote rural communities, are currently modeled with homogenous and coarse load profiles developed from aggregated data. An objective of AMR deployment is to clarify the nature and variability of the residential LV customer. In this paper, an algorithm for tracking the consistency of the behavior of small loads is presented. This would allow them to be assessed for their availability to provide demand services to the grid. In the method presented, significant changes in behavior are detected using Bayesian changepoint analysis which tracks a multivariate Gaussian representation of a residential load profile on a day to day basis. A hypothetical single phase feeder, representative of an islanded rural power system, is used to illustrate the detected heterogeneity of load behavior consistency.","title":"Online AMR domestic load profile characteristic change monitor to support ancillary demand services","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"488","weight":0.6875,"docData":{"date":"14\/08\/15","money":"198","wordCount":"128","university":"E","abstract":"Many countries around the world are challenged to meet the escalating demand for power often resulting in frequent blackouts. Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.","title":"Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"582","weight":0.6693,"docData":{"date":"23\/04\/18","money":"998","wordCount":"130","university":"B","abstract":"Recent developments in Optical IP networks have heightened the need for reduction on power consumption via so called green photonics and concepts known as green networking. Adhering to these principles we proposed a novel energy savings approach which can be applied to optical IP networks and is based on so called \"hibernation mode with segmentation link\" technique. The hibernation mode technique is designed to help to reduce power consumption by sleep the network links and can help to optimise network overall energy usage by taking advantage of the hibernation algorithms we have developed. The proper implementation over the network infrastructure will save energy, operating cost to network operators, and while at the same time will also deliver reduced carbon footprint. In this paper, we show design model for developing energy efficient Segment-Link approach. In this scheme, the improvised energy saving techniques focus on selective sleeping of optical core fibre links, following which the Routing Wavelength Assignment algorithm based on GMPLS control plane are investigated. Simulation models and results for the proposed scheme are evaluated in both the fibre link only and segmentation-link schemes scenarios. The results shows that a significant amount of energy can be saved if appropriate \"segmentation-link\" mechanisms using optical bypass and traffic grooming is invoked.","title":"Energy efficient segmentation-link strategies for transparent IP over WDM core networks","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"605","weight":0.6591,"docData":{"date":"19\/02\/18","money":"406","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"The MaidSafe network is an open-source, decentralised, autonomous network for data storage and retrieval by end user applications.

This has changed the way in which distribution networks operate, moving from a passive system, to a more active system where generation and demand are located closer together with system states being more complex and variable. Increased penetration of renewable generation into distribution networks is presenting a number of challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) including the provision of network access in capacity constrained networks. The introduction of Active Network Management (ANM) is enabling an increase in renewable generation connections through enhanced network access in otherwise \u2018full\u2019 networks. This paper presents a way in which DNOs might move towards Business as Usual (BAU) arrangements for ANM schemes. It is necessary to determine the curtailment arrangements, or Principles of Access (PoA), and from this estimate generation access under ANM and the flow of services and money for different scenarios. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review, detailed case study evaluation on early ANM schemes, quantitative curtailment assessment for different PoA and a qualitative analysis of business models for different ANM PoA is presented in turn with conclusions drawn from these three approaches.","title":"A review and analysis of renewable energy curtailment schemes and Principles of Access: transitioning towards business as usual","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"574","weight":0.6027,"docData":{"date":"21\/06\/15","money":"254","wordCount":"151","university":"E","abstract":"This paper investigates the use of a pilot signal in reducing the electrical peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) intensitymodulated optical wireless communication system. The phase of\nthe pilot signal is chosen based on the selected mapping (SLM) algorithm while the maximum likelihood criterion is used to estimate the pilot signal at the receiver. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the pilot-assisted optical OFDM system is identical to that of the basic optical OFDM (with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented) at the desired BER of less than 10−3 needed to establish a reliable communication link. The pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique results in higher reduction in PAPR for high order (M >4) constellations than the classical SLM. With respect to a basic OFDM system, with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented, a pilot-assisted M-QAM optical OFDM system is capable of reducing the electrical PAPR by over about 2.5 dB at a modest complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) point of 10−4 forM = 64. Greater reductions in PAPR are possible at lower values of CCDF with no degradation to the system\u2019s error performance. Clipping the time domain signal at both ends mildly (at 25 times the signal variance level) results in a PAPR reduction of about 6.3 dB at the same CCDF of 10−4 but with an error floor of about 3 × 10−5 .

In this paper we propose a system architecture that enables us to optimally size the ESS system according to the number of users.

Energy autarky can be described as  a location that relies on its own energy  resources  for  generating  the  useful  energy  required  to  sustain  the  society  within  that region  or a situation in which a region does not import substantial amounts of energy resources. Functioning  autarkic  energy  systems  typically  require  a  micro-grid,  well  understood  energy demand and supply characteristics, opportunities for energy storage of various types and controls able to  manage the harmonisation of system components. A critical additional ingredient is users who can work within constraints created by the adoption of autarkic principles.  To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in \ndelivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments.

The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage.

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply\u2013demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe.

The model has been applied for the case of Greece for the years 2012-2050 and has led to several interesting results. Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased. Summing-up, external cost has been found to be a significant percentage of the total electricity generation cost for some energy sources, therefore significantly changing the ranking order of cost-competitiveness for the energy sources examined.","title":"Incorporating life cycle external cost in optimization of the electricity generation mix","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"536","weight":0.4445,"docData":{"date":"03\/06\/19","money":"852","wordCount":"135","university":"B","abstract":"The aim of cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is to inform the allocation of scarce resources. CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"279","weight":0.4202,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/15","money":"623","wordCount":"119","university":"C","abstract":"In electricity markets, where conditions are uncertain, the choice of the best technology and the optimisation of production processes may not anymore be enough to ensure optimal investment yield of energy business plans.

Traditional investment analysis methods are considered marginally useful to analyse this case. Instead, the recent tools of time-dependent investment analysis are more appropriate, since they are not inherently restricted to immediate, irreversible decisions. In the present work, a time-dependent computational model is presented and applied in the case study of the Greek Power Sector, in order to estimate the potential advantages of the fuel switching concept. Moreover, the optimal timing of switching is derived, to ensure increasing yields of an average-capacity power-plant.

This paper reviews Scottish energy strategy since 1999 and notes the stronger policy link in recent years between investment in low carbon and renewable energy and related employment growth. The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on \u201Ctemporary-long term\u201D or \u201Cdomestic-global\u201D axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast.

This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory.

When compared to onshore wind, O&M costs are increased, due to the use of specialised vessels, shorter weather windows and challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of offshore wind industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus of this paper is to provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the offshore wind farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations. The developed methodology and analysis enable operators to decide the specification of CTVs which will bring the optimum financial benefit, considering both the enhancement of the offshore wind farm power generation as well as the minimisation of the total O&M cost.","title":"Optimum CTV fleet selection for offshore wind farm O&M activities","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"662","weight":0.1319,"docData":{"date":"23\/12\/15","money":"873","wordCount":"91","university":"C","abstract":"The friendship paradox states that your friends have on average more friends than you have.

The impact of oxidative stress and free radicals on the ocular surface is increasingly being recognized. Hyaluronic acid (HA) has anti-inflammatory properties and is abundantly present in AM. In this in vitro pilot study, we investigated the potential of AM for intrinsic free radical scavenging properties.\nMethods\n\nStrips of AM were incubated in sealed tubes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After being sonicated, uptake of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide\/Peroxidase assay. For comparison, 1630 kDA HA was used.\nResults\nThere was uptake of ROS by all AM samples, which decreased with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Mean ROS uptake for 5 different AMs at 1 hour was significantly greater for 50 μM (83%; SD 11.7, SEM 5.23) compared with 100 μM (67%; SD 20.48, SEM 9.16; p = 0.028; 95% CI 2.8-29.2). The HA comparison group showed similar uptake and trend. \nConclusion\nThis pilot study demonstrates that AM is able to remove ROS from its environment.

Despite the attention paid to its causes and consequences, recent research has largely set aside questions about professionalism\u2019s conceptualization and operationalization. Usually measuring it as an aggregate index, scholars theoretically and empirically treat professionalism as a unidimensional concept. In this article, we argue that exclusive use of aggregate indices can limit state politics research. Using a new dataset with almost 40 years of data on state legislative resources, salary, and session length, we reconsider the validity of using an index to study professionalism across the states. We evaluate the internal consistency of professionalism components over time, the relationship between components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling. We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating multidimensional measures. Scholars should take care to choose the appropriate measure of the concept that best fits the causal relationships under examination.","title":"Should we measure professionalism with an index?

Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce.

Whilst well implanted in the machining and cutting industry, vacuum coatings face important challenges for the fabrication of forming tools, and more specifically in hot forming, due to the extreme operation conditions to be met, such as high loading forces, impact\/thermal cycling, working material adhesion, etc. Present and future coatings adapted to hot work tooling are discussed in this paper: transition metal nitrides, carbon nitrides, borides and mixed oxides are among the currently postulated coating formulations for high temperature forming. The study is complemented with current strategies of characterizing the properties of the coatings in the adequate environment of high temperatures and contact loadings.

The data available is, however, quite limited from the scientific literatures on the field trials with reliable, statistical relevance, which is, probably, attributed to the high costs normally incurred for carrying out experiments in real industrial environment.

Donors must first decide whether to participate in a multilateral institution. They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows.

For deep waters where floating wind turbines are the feasible support structure option, the vertical axis wind turbine concept might prove to be one of these optimal configurations. This paper carries out a preliminary investigation into the dynamics of a vertical axis wind turbine coupled with three generic floating support structures originally intended for horizontal axis wind turbines. The modifications to the original characteristics of the support structures were kept to a minimum to illustrate the use of floating horizontal axis wind turbine platforms for floating vertical axis wind turbines Issues regarding the adequacy of the mooring systems are outlined and an overview of platform responses in a number of varying met-ocean conditions is presented and discussed.","title":"A comparison on the dynamics of a floating vertical axis wind turbine on three different floating support structures","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"520","weight":0.0266,"docData":{"date":"26\/08\/18","money":"339","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"We have a limited understanding of the consequences of variations in microbial biodiversity on ocean ecosystem functioning and global biogeochemical cycles. A core process is macronutrient uptake by microorganisms, as the uptake of nutrients controls ocean CO2 fixation rates in many regions. Here, we ask whether variations in ocean phytoplankton biodiversity lead to novel functional relationships between environmental variability and phosphate (Pi) uptake. We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans. Thus, it demonstrates that microbial biodiversity, beyond cell size, is important for understanding the global cycling of nutrients.","title":"Impact of ocean phytoplankton diversity on phosphate uptake","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"727","weight":0.0137,"docData":{"date":"28\/09\/19","money":"103","wordCount":"146","university":"C","abstract":"Purpose: This article explores the nature and role of career boundaries for enabling\/constraining career self-management for occupational boundary-crossing in the UK graduate labour market.\nMethodology: The data is provided by career history interviews with 36 UK graduates. The analysis contrasts transitions for those who started careers in low- intermediate- and high-skilled segments of the labour market.\nFindings: Availability of development and progression opportunities were the most prominent career boundary experienced. Ease of boundary-crossing differed by career stage and educational background. Boundaries enabled career self-management by acting as psychological\/external push factors, but push factors only aided progression to high-skilled segments for a third of graduates who started careers in underemployment. For the rest, an adaptation of expectations to labour market realities was observed.\nResearch limitations\/implications: Although career history interviews limit generalisability, they contextualise boundaries and deepen understanding of career actors\u2019 subjective experiences and responses.   \nPractical implications: The study highlights the role of labour market and demand-side constraints for career transitions as well as proactive career behaviours. This has implications for career counsellors, employers and individuals.\nOriginality\/value: This article provides a distinctive \u2018boundary-focused\u2019 analysis of emerging career boundaries in the graduate labour market. The findings point to the intricate interplay between structure and agency for career development.","title":"Coping with career boundaries and boundary-crossing in the graduate labour

At the same time, it is important to note that there is very little published research dealing with alternative forms of assessment in the field of physical education teacher education (PETE). In this paper we seek to make a case for democratic assessment practices within a critical pedagogy of PETE. We begin by outlining developments in assessment in higher education in general, before considering student participation in assessment processes. We then consider some strategies of participative assessment, and discuss their benefits, risks and difficulties. An account of the experience of the National Network of Formative and Shared Assessment in Higher Education in Spain provides us with a working example of the implementation of democratic practices in assessment in PETE. We conclude that the lack of research in physical education on democratic assessment practices raises serious questions about the extent to which our field is committed to producing teachers capable of meeting the complex social and cultural challenges they will surely meet in the schools of tomorrow.","title":"Making the case for democratic assessment practices within a critical pedagogy of physical education teacher education","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"506","weight":0.9524,"docData":{"date":"11\/02\/18","money":"390","wordCount":"84","university":"D","abstract":"In 2013, the University of Strathclyde became the first Scottish university to receive the prestigious THES UK entrepreneurial university of the year award.

An eight-person research team was assembled at the University of Strathclyde to investigate, support and raise awareness of the key factors affecting successful STEM transition from secondary school to university. The group made up from students and academics was a novel approach and aimed at developing their knowledge of the current Scottish education system whilst developing partnerships with secondary schools in the local Glasgow area.\nSeveral peer discussion groups were conducted as part of the methodology and it was through these that ideas, such as a student elective scheme allowing university students to enter schools and run project based learning workshops, could benefit the transition strategy for young people to enter the STEM based disciplines at university. The outlined proposals, when implemented, have the possibility of negating the previous inconsistency of previous attempts to address the problem of successful STEM transition.

In this paper we discuss existing views that conceptualize creativity and innovation in this sector as a sequential developmental process following the principles of operations management. However, based on in-depth interviews with world-renowned chefs we argue for a systemic rather than sequential developmental process view. The reason for this is that the chefs interviewed understand the \u2018creativity-part\u2019 of the innovation process as an embodied experience often guided by intuition and the \u2018innovation part\u2019 as a process of social evaluation greatly dependent on the perception, knowledge and value judgement of the testers from the leading restaurant guides.

This paper therefore analyses two distinct cases of open innovation in practice from the oil and gas industry. Empirical data suggests that it is possible to provide countless examples of observed open innovation activity. However, these are not necessarily a direct cause of strategic intent towards implementing \nopen innovation. Findings also show that if open innovation is to become a professionally managed activity, research needs to be aligned towards strategy of the firm. Open innovation is a change process that requires attention and commitment levels much like Lean and Six Sigma initiatives.

However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children\u2019s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.","title":"Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"334","weight":0.8608,"docData":{"date":"16\/03\/15","money":"298","wordCount":"79","university":"E","abstract":"Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), constitutes the demands that teachers are supposed to meet. Its intentions for the mathematics curriculum are similar to those in many countries: that learners be sufficiently mathematically literate to use mathematics in the personal, professional and societal dimensions of their lives. But like many attempts to reform mathematical curricula elsewhere, CfE does not address the fundamental issue of mathematical understanding. Of course, learner understanding transcends the mathematical curriculum per se, but the significance of mathematical understanding for competent functioning exemplifies the imperative of teaching for understanding or 'deep learning'. The essay begins with some conceptual 'ground clearing' to establish mathematical understanding as a neglected issue.  It then considers what mathematical understanding is, why it is important, the increasingly important role of metacognition, and the very necessary role of teachers. At each of these points, implications for pedagogical practice are raised.","title":"Articulating 'understanding': deploying mathematical metacognition","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"320","weight":0.8506,"docData":{"date":"31\/08\/18","money":"860","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"The paper informs on the emerging innovative solutions and practice in strengthening the resilience of architectural and urban heritage in Scotland in the context of key global risks such as peak oil, climate change, growing global population and species extinction.

We identify two main groupings of mediators: those who practise by virtue of their personal characteristics, discipline or profession of origin, and those whose recognised social standing, eldership or prestige within a given community qualify them to act as mediators. We also review some of the many debates and discourses at play in the field.\n\nWe find that a coherent account of mediators\u2019 traits is still missing from the literature.

Our goal is to broaden the understanding of online teacher education programmes at undergraduate level in contexts where most trainees are practicing teachers and where online education is the only possibility for holding a teaching qualification. We focused on the motivating factors that led 71 trainees to enrol and to remain in this online teacher training course.

The Lab took place in June 2015.\n\nThe Experience Lab aimed to co-create scenarios in which digital interventions could be used as motivation to increase the level of physical activity for dads, as a means of reducing the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. We looked at how the daily life of the men taking part had changed when they became a dad, how these changes possibly influenced their level of physical activity, and what would motivate them to become more active.\n\nThe Lab provided a safe and creative environment through which the Lab team helped participants (\u201Cexperienced dads\u201D) to feel comfortable to share stories, reflect on their lives and explore their motivations. The information gathered was then used to co-create possible scenarios for ways in which digital interventions could motivate the participants to enjoy an active everyday life.\n\nA series of activities including a physical work out, fireplace story sharing, mapping and a co-creation session were designed to gain insights into what appropriate support for dads in maintaining an active lifestyle would look like.\n\nThe outputs from the Lab included audio, photos, videos and field notes which were analysed for emerging themes.\n\nThe Experience Lab showed that a key to maintaining an active lifestyle is balancing a man\u2019s time as a dad and his personal time, which was described as very challenging by the participants. Whether you need to sleep, go to the pub, work in the garden or go for a run, it is that time for yourself that most men feel like they must give up once they become a dad. It became apparent that the activities participants engaged in during the Lab day served as a moment to reflect on the balance of their lives. More than the solutions co-created, the greatest value was gained from the activity of reflecting and identifying different stages in their lives with accompanying behavioural changes.\n\nIt should be noted that the Lab involved a small number of participants, but that the intimate setting allowed participants to feel comfortable to share experiences on an emotional level, which made it possible to gather the qualitative insights included in our report.","title":"Boys and their Toys","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"231","weight":0.7974,"docData":{"date":"21\/09\/19","money":"851","wordCount":"153","university":"D","abstract":"The context for the study is the current curriculum reform in Scotland (Curriculum for Excellence) which demands that teachers enable children to become \u2018Responsible Citizens\u2019. Education for Citizenship, as opposed to Citizenship Education, in Scotland is not a discrete subject; the objective is that citizenship permeates everything that happens throughout school, academically and socially. It is centrally situated alongside children becoming \u2018effective contributors\u2019, \u2018successful learners\u2019 and \u2018confident individuals\u2019. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of Community of Philosophical Inquiry (CoPI) as a pedagogical tool to enhance citizenship attributes in Scottish children in a range of educational settings. In order, first, to get an insight into the teachers\u2019 perspectives on the Education for Citizenship agenda in Scotland, the teachers were asked for their definitions of \u2018citizen\u2019. Similarly, the children were also asked about their notion of \u2018citizen\u2019. The children\u2019s group betrayed a more political understanding of \u2018citizen\u2019 than the teachers. Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as \u2018informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues\u2019. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children\u2019s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI.

This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines. Similarly, system designers can devise interfaces that suit students' needs.","title":"Student search behaviour in an online public access catalogue: an examination of 'searching mental models' and 'searcher self-concept'","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"3","weight":0.7833,"docData":{"date":"07\/04\/18","money":"451","wordCount":"143","university":"D","abstract":"Our aim is to explore student teachers\u2019 perceptions of what constitutes critical learning incidents in their very early careers.

The research team consisted of four action researchers who were each attached to an artist in residence working in four theatre venues across Scotland.

The researchers collaborated with the artists to observe children\u2019s engagement, provide feedback, discuss projects, and record the processes of project development. This paper seeks to explore the artists' experience of designing and implementing participative performance events and the nature and processes of working with young children in performing arts.\nIt focuses on an exploration of the creative learning processes which were developed by the artists in residence to promote children's creativity and involvement in the visual arts. The role of the artist is examined and key aspects are suggested with a view to enhancing the creative learning experiences provided for children within educational contexts, indicating points for consideration by adults charged with the responsibility of planning and developing environments which support young children's creativity.","title":"Exploring creative environments through the child's lens","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"74","weight":0.7808,"docData":{"date":"08\/06\/16","money":"270","wordCount":"114","university":"B","abstract":"Language professionals across the United Kingdom have long been apprehensive about low levels of participation in language learning, as well as disparities in gender and social class of language learners.

In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only \u2018fully\u2019 participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could \u2018hide behind the camera\u2019 and were not required to participate physically.

Doing so is regarded as a way of meeting individual needs and improving academic standards. Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective \u2013 and potentially antagonistic - social identities.","title":"Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"210","weight":0.762,"docData":{"date":"07\/06\/15","money":"413","wordCount":"84","university":"C","abstract":"Our undergraduate civil engineering students have access to a rich and diverse bank of textual and graphical knowledge concerning their chosen profession.

At first, these are basic and simple, but over development they become serially organised into projects requiring greater knowledge of their distal consequences, as they expand in capacity and reach.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language.

A narrow view of the process, one focused on short-term revenue maximisation principles, is inadequate due to secondary system elements that can impact technology commercialisation outcomes.

Healthcare professionals caring for people with limb absence understand the mobility challenges which can face their patients during prosthetic rehabilitation and beyond, so how relevant and realistic is physical activity promotion for this population? The purpose of this presentation is to discuss current physical activity recommendations for the general population. Evidenced-based practice on physical activity promotion will also be presented.

These seminars provided a space to critically engage with the notion of consumer vulnerability in two key ways. First, they brought together international speakers from the fields of marketing, consumer research, sociology, social policy, law and medicine to ensure developments in thinking and best practice were shared across academic networks and across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Second, policy and practitioner organisations played a key role in our series, thereby adding a more practical element to discussions. An overarching concern emerging from the seminar series was the nature of the language we use when discussing those experiencing vulnerability, and how this language impacts on the relationship s between individuals and the services they used (both private and non - commercial). In particular, this presentation will consider the issues involved when approaching vulnerability with consumer - focused terminology.","title":"Patient, client, user, consumer?

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","title":"Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"52","weight":0.6102,"docData":{"date":"01\/05\/19","money":"234","wordCount":"59","university":"E","abstract":"Learning networks offer a context and methodology for business managers to learn from each other\u2019s experience.

How do states choose organizations for cooperation? We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991\u20132011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects. States implement projects in collaboration with the World Bank, which has the most expertise and resources among the GEF\u2019s implementing agencies, if their regime type is democracy, the project size is large, and the benefits are primarily national.

The presentation discusses initial findings from fieldwork conducted in a school in the United Kingdom, which researched young people\u2019s conceptions of political information, how they interact with information sources and how this relates to their sense of political agency. The research sought a\ndeep understanding of the topic and took a phenomenographic approach.

One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment.

There were many innovations in the field of agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850s and 1860s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the steam plough, with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870s and 1880s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the steam plough in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to have a major impact on rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler\u2019s steam\nplough.What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure.\nThe environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible. This article will interrogate why, despite its essential unfeasibility, the project was pursued, and will argue that the momentum created by the dynamic between the three networks involved propelled it forward despite growing evidence of failure.\nThis article therefore uses an inductive approach by examining a particular example of agricultural design innovation and analysing the pertinent social issues in what would have been termed by contemporaries \u2018entrepreneurial spirit\u2019.","title":"The role of social networks in agricultural innovation: the Sutherland reclamations and the Fowler steam plough, c.1855-c.1885","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"449","weight":0.4667,"docData":{"date":"01\/02\/18","money":"337","wordCount":"90","university":"C","abstract":"Multilateral funding for global environmental protection, such as biodiversity conservation, requires donor participation.

Donors must first decide whether to participate in a multilateral institution. They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows.

Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further harmonisation is needed, but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively.

Drawing upon insights from military personnel, intelligence operatives, journalists and others, this study uses Social Exchange Theory (SET) to frame our understanding of their underpinning cultural code, the Pashtunwali. The study contributes both theoretically and empirically: The nature of the Pashtunwali highlights that SET cannot adequately frame some cultural exchange practices and a hybrid framework for negotiated and reciprocal exchange is presented. Furthermore, contextually, this is the first study that explores a code of hospitality through a social exchange lens to explore potential tourism development.  A framework exists upon which commercial activity can be built without altering beliefs, social dynamics or day to day pursuits. For commercial development to be successful, it must yield similar or greater levels of income to those that currently exist, more importantly, traditions of autonomy and self-dependence will affect employment and training within an emergent tourism industry.","title":"Hospitality codes and social exchange theory: the Pashtunwali and tourism in Afghanistan","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"57","weight":0.4409,"docData":{"date":"13\/11\/15","money":"248","wordCount":"93","university":"B","abstract":"Graduates from higher education often enter the labour market with a considerable amount of work experience. Using German data, we address the question of whether early work experience pays off upon labour market entry. We compare the labour market benefits of different types of work experience. This comparison allows us to more generally test hypotheses about different explanations of why education pays off. Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme. Even though field-related and voluntary work experience helps graduates to realize a fast integration into the labour market, it is not linked to higher chances for entering a favourable class position or to higher wages in the long run. These results provide evidence for the signalling explanation of educational benefits in the labour market rather than the human capital explanation.","title":"The effects of work experience during higher education on labour market entry: learning by doing or an entry ticket?","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"431","weight":0.4384,"docData":{"date":"04\/10\/16","money":"941","wordCount":"73","university":"D","abstract":"This article questions the preconceived notions that participants in virtual worlds are essentially consumers.

This is compounded by the fact that young men are significantly less likely than young women to seek help for physical, emotional and other problems, leaving them open to prolonged suffering.

As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes. Further concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders are required to fully integrate preoperative assessment within the health-board surgical care pathway. A substantial \u2013 yet unfulfilled \u2013 potential benefit in embedding information technology in routine use within the preoperative clinic would be to improve the reporting of surgical outcomes.","title":"A study of clinical and information management processes in the surgical pre-assessment clinic","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"286","weight":0.4051,"docData":{"date":"21\/09\/15","money":"657","wordCount":"79","university":"D","abstract":"This magazine focuses on improving educational outcomes for looked after children, young people and those who have recently left care.

How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.\nThe study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011\u201312, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"301","weight":0.381,"docData":{"date":"02\/11\/15","money":"998","wordCount":"84","university":"B","abstract":"he provision of support to families is an important part of a system that effectively supports children and young people who are involved in offending behaviours.

It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned.

This paper explores the safeguarding concerns and responses for children and young people who run away or go missing from home. The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.","title":"'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"767","weight":0.3721,"docData":{"date":"25\/10\/15","money":"302","wordCount":"172","university":"C","abstract":"The Active Healthy Kids Canada (AHKC) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth has been effective in powering the movement to get kids moving by influencing priorities, policies, and practice in Canada.

The 15 Report Cards were presented at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children in Toronto on May 20, 2014.

Many countries have insufficient information to assign a grade, particularly for the Active Play and Family and Peers indicators. Grades for Sedentary Behaviors are, in general, better in low income countries. The Community and Built Environment indicator received high grades in high income countries and notably lower grades in low income countries. There was a pattern of higher PA and lower sedentary behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower PA and higher sedentary behavior in countries reporting better infrastructure, which presents an interesting paradox.

Whilst well implanted in the machining and cutting industry, vacuum coatings face important challenges for the fabrication of forming tools, and more specifically in hot forming, due to the extreme operation conditions to be met, such as high loading forces, impact\/thermal cycling, working material adhesion, etc. Present and future coatings adapted to hot work tooling are discussed in this paper: transition metal nitrides, carbon nitrides, borides and mixed oxides are among the currently postulated coating formulations for high temperature forming. The study is complemented with current strategies of characterizing the properties of the coatings in the adequate environment of high temperatures and contact loadings. To this aspect, a number of examples, from using standard laboratory equipment to the use of in-house developed tribological set-ups, are given, together with recent findings obtained from the authors\u2019 research groups. The data available is, however, quite limited from the scientific literatures on the field trials with reliable, statistical relevance, which is, probably, attributed to the high costs normally incurred for carrying out experiments in real industrial environment. Nevertheless, we could still draw a conclusion of that vacuum coating for tooling applications is at a front edge of knowledge generation and technology transfer to industry, and while being already mature, there is still a needed effort for significant industrial up-take from the novel coatings developed or being under the development.","title":"Vapour deposition technologies for the fabrication of hot-forming tools: a review","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"483","weight":0.3572,"docData":{"date":"10\/07\/17","money":"320","wordCount":"28","university":"D","abstract":"This interim report details work carried out by the University of Strathclyde to develop methods for analysis of the potential for ANM in managing voltage constraints along an 11kV feeder.

Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha\u2019s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.","title":"Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"9","weight":0.3511,"docData":{"date":"17\/10\/15","money":"194","wordCount":"94","university":"C","abstract":"In the context of healthcare, the ECJ's jurisprudence has recently been clarified and codified in Directive 2011\/24\/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (\"Patients' Mobility Directive\").

While the facts of Femarbel and Ottica do not bear much resemblance to each other, the judgments illustrate that the definition of what falls under the umbrella of healthcare services is not always obvious. Moreover, the cases provide a timely example of attempts by commercial interest groups to use EU law to open up domestic healthcare markets to private, commercial service providers.

It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services.

However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"185","weight":0.3282,"docData":{"date":"01\/06\/18","money":"756","wordCount":"64","university":"D","abstract":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde (GG&C) and Macmillan Cancer Support funded in 2013 the roll out of a new Macmillan Pharmacy Service following a successful development program across all six Community Health (and Care) Partnerships (CH(C)Ps).

While unequivocal identification of the relevant genes has, for the most part, remained elusive, the genes revealed as potential candidates can in many cases be clustered into functionally-related groups which are potentially open to therapeutic intervention. In this review, we summarise this information, focussing on the accumulating evidence that genetic dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses and post-synaptic signalling complexes contributes to the aetiology of the disease. In particular, there is converging support for involvement of post-synaptic JNK pathways in disease aetiology. An expansion of our neurobiological knowledge of the basis of schizophrenia is urgently needed, yet some promising novel pharmacological targets can already be discerned.","title":"Novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia from improved understanding of genetic risk","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"239","weight":0.3215,"docData":{"date":"25\/12\/19","money":"387","wordCount":"112","university":"C","abstract":"Recent research in different parts of the UK has pointed to growing acceptance of the mediation process from legal professionals with promises of potential costs savings for end-users.

This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper.

Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another \u2018homeland\u2019 (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).\nScotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.

However, varying temporal and spatial demand patterns of EVs threatens power grid operations and its physical components. Thus, the ability of the power grid to handle the potential extra load has become a major factor in the mainstream success. In order for this integration to occur seamlessly, the power grid and the consumers need to be coordinated in harmony. In this paper, we address the critical challenges introduced by the penetration of EVs, systematically categorize the proposed frameworks for demand management, and the role of information and communication technologies in the solution process. We provide a comprehensive survey on the communication requirements, the standards and the candidate technologies towards the Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV). This survey summarizes the current state of research efforts in electric vehicle demand management and aims to shed light on the continued studies.","title":"A survey on communication technologies and requirements for internet of electric vehicles","authors":"E & F & G"}},{"docId":"157","weight":0.3029,"docData":{"date":"31\/07\/16","money":"291","wordCount":"142","university":"B","abstract":"This report examines the experiences of Employment Tribunal (ET) claimants after an ET award was made in their favour. A workers\u2019 success in the ET is by no means the end of the story when it comes to achieving justice for a wrongdoing against them in the workplace. Enforcing an award made by an ET can itself be highly problematic . 1 The data presented in this report were collected as part of a European Research Council funded project entitled Citizens Advice Bureaux and Employment Disputes . 2 The overall aim of this project was to understand workers\u2019 experiences as they attempted to resolve problems faced at work, including identifying potential barriers to justice. Our particular focus was on workers who could not easily afford the services of a solicitor. As such, participants were recruited through Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) who are a key provider of employment advice to this group. We tracked the experiences of workers as they sought to resolve their workplace disputes \u2013 from their initial advice sessions with CABx to the closure ( or in some cases abandonment ) of the problem. The vast majority of our participants who pursued their claims in the ET did so prior to the introduction of fees on 29 July 2013. The report focuses on the paths taken and overall outcomes for participants who were successful with their claim in the ET. It begins by providing a brief overview of the system for enforcing ET awards. The key findings from our participant group are then presented in three sections : firstly, a summary of the outcomes of our participants; secondly, experiences of those who took formal action to enforce their ET awards; and, thirdly, experiences of those who did not take formal action to enforce their ET awards. Finally, detailed vignettes elaborating on and contextualising these findings in relation to specific individuals are presented.","title":"Enforcement of Employment Tribunal Awards","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"727","weight":0.2877,"docData":{"date":"28\/09\/19","money":"103","wordCount":"146","university":"C","abstract":"Purpose: This article explores the nature and role of career boundaries for enabling\/constraining career self-management for occupational boundary-crossing in the UK graduate labour market.\nMethodology: The data is provided by career history interviews with 36 UK graduates. The analysis contrasts transitions for those who started careers in low- intermediate- and high-skilled segments of the labour market.\nFindings: Availability of development and progression opportunities were the most prominent career boundary experienced. Ease of boundary-crossing differed by career stage and educational background. Boundaries enabled career self-management by acting as psychological\/external push factors, but push factors only aided progression to high-skilled segments for a third of graduates who started careers in underemployment. For the rest, an adaptation of expectations to labour market realities was observed.\nResearch limitations\/implications: Although career history interviews limit generalisability, they contextualise boundaries and deepen understanding of career actors\u2019 subjective experiences and responses.   \nPractical implications: The study highlights the role of labour market and demand-side constraints for career transitions as well as proactive career behaviours. This has implications for career counsellors, employers and individuals.\nOriginality\/value: This article provides a distinctive \u2018boundary-focused\u2019 analysis of emerging career boundaries in the graduate labour market.

However, without easy to use sensors for nurses and carers these potentially important near-patient diagnostic parameters will not enter clinical diagnostics. This study focuses on a number of metrics for wound condition and wound healing: wound fluid pH, wound moisture, and wound matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzyme activity. To observe these important markers state of the art sensors have been developed that are based on inexpensive sensing technologies that can be integrated within wound dressings. These sensors will enable the wound healing markers to be studied and profiled in clinics which will further enhance the understanding of these markers and their relationship in the complex healing process involved in chronic wound healing.","title":"Development of wearable sensors for tailored patient wound care","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"312","weight":0.2728,"docData":{"date":"22\/12\/17","money":"372","wordCount":"187","university":"E","abstract":"The focus is on the protracted dispute (2009 - 2011) between British Airways (BA) and its cabin crew and their union BASSA (British Airlines\u2019 Stewards and Stewardesses Association). Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company\u2019s imposition, in disregard of collective bargaining procedures, of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new \u2018mixed fleet\u2019 on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a \u2018strategy of decapitation\u2019 of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA\u2019s and crews\u2019 utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a \u2018distributed discourse\u2019 and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions\u2019 ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA\u2019s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.","title":"Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"558","weight":0.2703,"docData":{"date":"11\/01\/16","money":"596","wordCount":"37","university":"D","abstract":"With the recent advances in laser technology, experimental investigation of radiation reaction phenomena is at last becoming a realistic prospect.

You reach the darkest point when you are in the deepest. Then, as you start your way out, there is gradually more and more light. Over the last quarter century we were getting deeper and deeper in. It seems that it is starting to get lighter now.\n\nAs academics and consultants we have been working for, with and on top-level business decision takers involved in loosely structured decision problems. Gradually we have achieved better and better understanding of the models of thinking that can be useful for these decision takers. First we realized that the model of thinking needs to be simple; which is the philosophical commonplace of Occam\u2019s razor. Somewhat later we realized that it is easy to cut our-selves if Occam\u2019s razor is too sharp \u2013 the model of thinking must not be too simple as it will fail to provide a usable representation of reality. This is also known from philosophy as Einstein\u2019s extension of Occam\u2019s rule: as simple as possible but not simpler than that. Along these lines we have developed the Doctus knowledge-based system shell, for building our models. This way we started building the bridge of trans-disciplinarity between the knowledge do-mains of various experts. However, this bridge is narrow and difficult to use for crossing the disciplinary divides. Decision takers cannot walk the bridge alone; they need a bridge-guide called the knowledge engineer. The knowledge engineer is not a polymath (expert in multiple domains); the knowledge engineer\u2019s expertise is about knowledge and knowers.\n\nMore recently we have realized that it is not sufficient if the model is useful, it also has to be usable. The bridge should be wide, stable and easy to walk. Of course, it is still nice to have the knowledge engineer to guide the decision taker \u2013 it provides a fuller experience. What makes for such bridge? Today we think that we need to apply Occam\u2019s razor tempered by Einstein on the user interface the same way as we have previously used it for representing knowledge.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"211","weight":0.2632,"docData":{"date":"30\/05\/16","money":"819","wordCount":"76","university":"D","abstract":"We develop a model to capture state-of-knowledge, as well as aleatory, uncertainties associated with off-shore wind farm technologies, processes and environments.

However, the issue of potential spillover effects on energy demand (and supply) from energy efficiency improvements in one region\/nation on others have generally been neglected (Madlener and Alcott, 2009; Sorrell, 2009; Turner, 2013; Van den Bergh, 2011).

While basic theoretical contributions on the issue of \u2018global rebound\u2019 have been made (e.g. Wei, 2010) and some applied studies have been conducted (e.g. Barker et al., 2009), there exist no applied macro-level rebound studies to date that attempt to fully consider and identify the types of channels through which energy efficiency increases in one region\/nation may impact energy demand and supply conditions in others. This is an important knowledge gap, particularly given the global nature of energy-related climate change and the context of supra-national policy targets such as the EU 20-20-20 framework. The potential for energy efficiency policy actions taken in one country to impact energy use (and related emissions) in others implies that target setting and implementation decisions in different member states may not be regarded as independent.","title":"Beyond national economy-wide rebound effects: an applied general equilibrium analysis incorporating international spillover effects","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"620","weight":0.25,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/16","money":"596","wordCount":"128","university":"A","abstract":"Anybody familiar with Paul Temporal\u2019s other works would also find his latest book Islamic Branding and Marketing: Creating a Global Islamic Business informative.

Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.","title":"Festival place or place of festival?

There is a need to develop effective reading comprehension interventions that fit easily into the school curriculum that can benefit all pupils. A feasibility study of reading comprehension strategies with good evidence of efficacy was undertaken in three mainstream primary schools in an area of social deprivation in west central Scotland, to decide whether further investigation of this intervention was warranted.\nAims were to measure comprehension of spoken language and reading via standardised assessments towards the beginning of the school year (T1) in mainstream primary school classrooms within an area of social deprivation; to have teachers introduce previously-validated text comprehension strategies, and to measure change in reading comprehension outcome measures towards the end of the year (T2). \nA pre- and post-intervention cohort design was used. Reading comprehension strategies were introduced to staff in participating schools and used throughout the school year as part of on-going reading instruction. Spoken language comprehension was measured by TROG-2 at T1, and reading progress by score changes T1-T2 on the WIAT-IIUK-T reading comprehension scale. \nForty-seven pupils in five classes in three primary schools took part: 38% had TROG-2 scores below the 10th centile. As a group, children made good reading comprehension progress, with a medium standardised effect size of 0.46. Children with TROG-2 scores below 10%ile had lower mean reading scores than others at T1 and T2, although with considerable overlap. However, TROG-2 did not make a unique contribution to reading progress: children below 10%ile made as much progress as other children.

Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.","title":"Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket","authors":"B & C & D"}},{"docId":"163","weight":0.2462,"docData":{"date":"17\/04\/16","money":"665","wordCount":"65","university":"C","abstract":"The mechanistic worldview that has determined nature as a machine composed of related but discrete components helps to support the commonly held idea that humans are at the pinnacle of creation, the source of all value, the measure of all things.

Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.","title":"A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"391","weight":0.2302,"docData":{"date":"05\/07\/16","money":"679","wordCount":"126","university":"C","abstract":"Since assuming power after the 1994 genocide, President Paul Kagame and his political party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, have struggled to unite Rwanda's citizens using, among other initiatives, a simplified version of Rwandan history to diminish the ethnic tensions that made the 1994 genocide possible. As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation\u2019s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences. This paper focuses on divergent representations of Rwandan monarchical figures \u2013 often unnamed \u2013 whom the narrators imbue with values according to their individual political affiliations, lived experiences, and identity. These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.","title":"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"736","weight":0.2223,"docData":{"date":"16\/04\/16","money":"390","wordCount":"126","university":"B","abstract":"State-of-the-art scenario exercises in the energy and environment fields argue for combining qualitative storylines with quantitative modelling. This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply\u2013demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key.","title":"Linking a storyline with multiple models: a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"536","weight":0.2223,"docData":{"date":"03\/06\/19","money":"852","wordCount":"135","university":"B","abstract":"The aim of cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is to inform the allocation of scarce resources. CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.","title":"STAR\u2014people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"652","weight":0.2197,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/18","money":"369","wordCount":"132","university":"E","abstract":"The significance continues to grow of scholarship that embraces critical and contextualized entrepreneurship, seeking rich explorations of diverse entrepreneurship contexts. Following these influences, this study explores the potentialized context of punk entrepreneurship. The Punk Rock band Rancid has a 20-year history of successfully creating independent musical and related creative enterprises from the margins of the music industry. The study draws on artefacts, interviews and videos created by and around Rancid to identify and analyse this example of marginal, alternative entrepreneurship. A three-part analytic frame was applied to analysing these artefacts. Place is critical to Rancid\u2019s enterprise, grounding the band socially, culturally, geographically and politically. Practice also plays an important role with Rancid\u2019s activities encompassing labour, making music, movement and human interactions. The third, and most prevalent, dimension of alterity is that of power which includes data related to dominance, subordination, exclusion, control and liberation. Rancid\u2019s entrepreneurial story is depicted as cycles, not just a linear journey, but following more complicated paths \u2013 from periphery to centre, and back again; returning to roots, whilst trying to move forwards too; grounded in tradition but also radically focused on dramatic change.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.","title":"Quantum trajectories and open many-body quantum systems","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"379","weight":0.21,"docData":{"date":"01\/08\/15","money":"505","wordCount":"100","university":"C","abstract":"This article begins with a simple observation: there are very few contemporary Hollywood films in which women are shown becoming friends.

Energy autarky can be described as  a location that relies on its own energy  resources  for  generating  the  useful  energy  required  to  sustain  the  society  within  that region  or a situation in which a region does not import substantial amounts of energy resources. Functioning  autarkic  energy  systems  typically  require  a  micro-grid,  well  understood  energy demand and supply characteristics, opportunities for energy storage of various types and controls able to  manage the harmonisation of system components. A critical additional ingredient is users who can work within constraints created by the adoption of autarkic principles.  To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in \ndelivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments.

Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives. The decrease in acquisition risk post-SOX cannot be solely attributed to changes in the structure of executive compensation but it additionally stems from the way managers perceive compensation-based incentives in the new regulatory environment.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

In view of the decreasing levels of physical activity and motor skills in children over the past decades, an appropriate assessment and monitoring of motor competence in early childhood is invaluable, for both research and practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the convergent validity between two motor competence assessment tools: the Körperkoordinations Test für Kinder (KTK) and the Motoriktest für Vier- bis Sechsjährige Kinder (MOT 4-6). \nMethods and results: Five hundred and thirty 5- and 6- year-old children (277 ♂ and 253 ♀; mean age = 5.95; SD = 0.57) were tested by practiced assessors on the KTK and MOT 4-6 during the same day. From the raw scores, a Motor Quotient was calculated based on normative data of the KTK and MOT 4-6.

The first functions as continuity, in so far as it is claimed that historical colonial dynamics are reproduced in contemporary postcolonial environments, broadly conceived.

The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that \u2018the making of Muslims\u2019 is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider \u2018decentring\u2019 of the West.

Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O\u2019Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010).

Furthermore, the analysis of the fishing vessels accidents and near misses as recorded in the UK MAIB (Marine Accident Investigation Branch) database for a period of 19 years is performed in order to derive the causal factors leading to the fishing vessel accidents. It is initially shown that the fatalities and injuries taking place due to fishing vessels\u2019 accidents have alarmingly remained unchanged over the last 15-20 years. Another key finding is that the number of accidents and near misses per day and night shifts is quite similar while most accidents take place in coastal waters.

We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed 'Game theoretic risks' in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing's perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap. Successful application of the framework justifies its potential for further testing in other supply chain risk quantification scenarios.","title":"A novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"311","weight":0.1448,"docData":{"date":"29\/05\/18","money":"701","wordCount":"152","university":"D","abstract":"An evidence-led scientific case for development of a space-based polar remote sensing platform at geostationary-like (GEO-like) altitudes is developed through methods including a data user survey. Whilst a GEO platform provides a near static perspective, multiple platforms are required to provide circumferential coverage. Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous. Users also find the placement of apogee over the pole to be preferable to the alternative scenarios. Thus, a clear majority of data users find the \u201CTaranis\u201D orbit concept to be better than a critical inclination orbit, due to the improved perspective offered. The geophysical products that would benefit from a GEO-like polar platform are mainly estimated from radiances in the visible\/near infrared and thermal parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is consistent with currently proven technologies from GEO. Based on the survey results, needs analysis, and current technology proven from GEO, scientific and observation requirements are developed along with two instrument concepts with eight and four channels, based on Flexible Combined Imager heritage. It is found that an operational system could, mostly likely, be deployed from an Ariane 5 ES to a 16-hour orbit, while a proof-of-concept system could be deployed from a Soyuz launch to the\nsame orbit.","title":"Concepts for a geostationary-like polar missions","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"514","weight":0.1409,"docData":{"date":"28\/11\/15","money":"370","wordCount":"71","university":"B","abstract":"The paper presents an overview and analysis of company acquisition activity in Scotland over the period 2003-12.

This study is focused on bridging the research gap through development of a novel risk management framework that merges the two quantitative techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief networks capture the interdependency between various risk factors while Game theory models the risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders in a supply network. The proposed framework segregates risk drivers, events and consequences and captures their interdependency. Development project of Boeing 787 aircraft was a unique venture in terms of its unconventional supply chain and unproven technology. Instead of the realization of anticipated shorter development time and reduced costs, the project turned out to be a fiasco. A new term \u2018game theoretic risks\u2019 has been coined to acknowledge the risks associated with conflicting incentives of various stakeholders in a supply network. \n\nResearch Approach: This study has focused on a review of the literature for establishing the research gap followed by designing of a novel framework (conceptual model) for quantification and management of supply chain risks. Subsequently, the model has been applied on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft.\n\nFindings and Originality: The developed framework is unique in its design merging two quantitative techniques in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management. Application of the novel framework on a case study of Boeing 787 project revealed its merits in terms of capturing the dynamics of interacting risk factors. Bayesian belief network is a useful modelling technique for risk quantification capturing the interdependency between various risks. Game theoretic modelling provides an opportunity to model the risks associated with conflicting incentives of the stakeholders within a supply network. Game theory based modelling captured the behaviour of suppliers in relation to the uncertainty about cost functions and the final response of Boeing to the delays caused by suppliers. The results clearly manifested importance of the game theoretic risks and as there was no policy to align the incentives of suppliers in Boeing 787 project, there was a major delay causing financial penalty to Boeing. Furthermore, lack of management expertise in Supply Chain Risk Management was a major factor for the higher development cost. It has been proved that lack of information in a supply chain affects the desired objectives of a project. To our best knowledge, such a framework has never been developed and applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management.\n\nResearch Impact: The output of this study will help researchers model the supply chain risks in a more realistic way and stimulate further research in this direction.\n\nPractical Impact: The application of our developed model on a case study reveals its practical impact. Had the Boeing considered the holistic view of the supply chain risks, the project delay and financial loss would not have materialized. Our model can be utilized in supply networks of other industries.","title":"Quantification of supply chain risks: development and application of a novel risk management framework","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"785","weight":0.1291,"docData":{"date":"30\/07\/15","money":"772","wordCount":"93","university":"D","abstract":"The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights has upheld the French law which prohibits the concealment of one\u2019s face in public places.

I demonstrate that a total element ordering is enough to deliver insertion and flattening algorithms, and show that (with care about the formulation of the types) the implementations remain as usual. Agda's instance arguments and pattern synonyms maximize the proof search done by the typechecker and minimize the appearance of proofs in program text, often eradicating them entirely.

Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes\u2019s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its \u2018natural\u2019 (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.","title":"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"396","weight":0.1213,"docData":{"date":"27\/07\/15","money":"520","wordCount":"66","university":"B","abstract":"The widespread opposition to unprecedented austerity measures in Greece provides a unique opportunity to study the causes of mass protest.

Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were counsellors in training. Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred\u2019, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 12-item facilitative relationship factor that cuts across Person-centred and Experiential subscales (alpha: .98), and a nonfacilitative directiveness factor (3 items, alpha: .89).

Associations between weight status at 11 years old and academic attainment assessed by national tests at 11, 13 and 16 years were examined in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Healthy weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) Z-score <1.04; overweight as BMI Z-score 1.04-1.63; obesity as BMI Z-score 1.64.  Data from 5966 participants with objectively measured weight status were examined: 71.4% were healthy weight (1935 males; 2325 females), 13.3% overweight (372 males; 420 females) and 15.3% obese (448 males; 466 females).

Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of offshore wind industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus of this paper is to provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the offshore wind farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations.

Valve failures can account for 7% or more of mechanical failures, and since a conventional power station will contain many hundreds of valves, this represents a significant asset base. This paper presents a prognostic approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of valves experiencing degradation, utilizing a similarity-based method. Case study data is generated through simulation of valves within a 400MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power station.\n\nHigh fidelity industrial simulators are often produced for operator training, to allow personnel to experience fault procedures and take corrective action in safe, simulation environment, without endangering staff or equipment. This work repurposes such a high fidelity simulator to generate the type of condition monitoring data which would be produced in the presence of a fault. A first principles model of valve degradation was used to generate multiple run-to- failure events, at different degradation rates. The associated parameter data was collected to generate a library of failure cases. This set of cases was partitioned into training and test sets for prognostic modelling and the similarity based prognostic technique applied to calculate RUL.

A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining \"a string of pearls\" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.","title":"A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control","authors":"K & L & M"}},{"docId":"612","weight":0.0846,"docData":{"date":"27\/05\/15","money":"113","wordCount":"142","university":"E","abstract":"Load reduction is increasingly seen as an essential part of controller and wind turbine design. On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.","title":"Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"740","weight":0.0805,"docData":{"date":"13\/02\/19","money":"100","wordCount":"87","university":"A","abstract":"In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated to quantify the social impact an individual has on his\/her community when he\/she performs any energy efficiency project and transmits that information to his\/her neighbours.

As recently as August 2013, Ofcom reported that fixed broadband uptake in Glasgow remained at 50%; this is significantly below the Scottish average of 68% (Ofcom, 2013). As the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 agenda of the United Kingdom government, which places government services online, becomes ever more pervasive this becomes a more pressing issue for the city. That needs to find ways to increase broadband adoption. There is also a need to uncover the deep seated reasons why there has been no improvement in fixed broadband uptake in the last five years in Glasgow. Internet access is lowest amongst the most deprived in society and those with the lowest incomes (SHS, 2012). Analysis based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation highlights that \u2018income deprivation in Glasgow City is greater than in Scotland as a whole\u2019- 21.5% of Glasgow\u2019s population were income deprived in 2012 (Scottish Government, 2012a, p3).\nThis paper focuses on the deprived areas of Glasgow and whether and how the most disadvantaged in the city use the Internet. The analysis draws on data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and from individuals in deprived areas. This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:\n In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?\n Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?\n What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?\nThe attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.\nSince geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to\n2\nhow they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.\nThere are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.\nThis paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.\nThe second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.\nThis paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities. There are multiple organisations which could assist in addressing the diverse needs of communities in increasing Internet access. However, they will need to work together and be responsive to the diverse needs of these communities. The evidence also provides direction for Glasgow City Council on ways to engage the disconnected, move forward with their Digital Strategy and close the Digital chasm that exists in the city.","title":"Internet access among the most income deprived: the case of Glasgow","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"87","weight":0.0564,"docData":{"date":"17\/04\/19","money":"415","wordCount":"71","university":"A","abstract":"The business surveys reviewed in this section provide a barometer for the Scottish economy and outlined below is an overview of key recent evidence.

Distributions of ten representative zooplankton taxa, from recent (2000-2009) Continuous Plankton Recorder data, are presented, along with basin-scale patterns of annual sea surface temperature and phytoplankton color.  The distribution patterns represent the manifestation of very different physiological, life history and ecological interactions of each taxon with the North Atlantic habitat characteristics. The paper then focuses on a pan-Atlantic compilation of demographic and life history information for the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, perhaps one of the most ecologically important and certainly the most studied zooplankton species in the North Atlantic. Abundance, dormancy, egg production and mortality in relation to temperature and phytoplankton biomass, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, are analyzed in the context of understanding factors involved in determining the distribution and abundance of C. finmarchicus across its range. Several themes emerge:  (1)  transport of C. finmarchicus is from the south to the north in the northeast Atlantic, but from the north to the south in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses to climate forcing on coastal shelves, , (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east while it occurs after the bloom in many western sites, (3) while the deep basins in the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea are primary sources of C. finmarchicus production,  the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the western North Atlantic shelves, (4) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production responses, (5) differences in functional responses in egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (6) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, and (7) differences in stage-specific mortality rates are related to bathymetry, temperature and potential predators, notably the abundance of congeners Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis, which likely feed on early life stages of C. finmarchicus. Two modeling approaches have previously been used to interpret the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in relation to the North Atlantic habitat. A statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical modeling approach, based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history and implemented by recent developments in coupled physical-life cycle modeling. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. A synthesis of the two modeling approaches to predict North Atlantic zooplankton species shifts, not only for C. finmarchicus, but also for other major taxa, is advocated. While the computational resource requirements and lack of species-specific life history information for physical-biological modeling hinder full application for many zooplankton taxa, use of the approach, where possible, to understand advective influences will provide insight for interpretation of statistical predictions from species distribution models.","title":"The North Atlantic Ocean as habitat for Calanus finmarchicus: environmental factors and life history traits","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"133","weight":0.0534,"docData":{"date":"25\/04\/18","money":"255","wordCount":"75","university":"A","abstract":"This paper presents an investigation into the properties of a stochastic process whereby the value of a fund grows arithmetically and decays geometrically over discrete time periods.

These domain-specific logics hamper any attempt to reuse code across similarly structured data. In this paper, we capitalise on the structural invariants of datatypes. To do so, we first adapt the notion of ornament to our universe of inductive families. We then show how code reuse can be achieved by ornamenting functions. Using these functional ornaments, we capture the relationship between functions such as the addition of natural numbers and the concatenation of lists. With this knowledge, we demonstrate how the implementation of the former informs the implementation of the latter: The users can ask the definition of addition to be lifted to lists and they will only be asked the details necessary to carry on adding lists rather than numbers.

The model has been applied for the case of Greece for the years 2012-2050 and has led to several interesting results. Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased.

Increased penetration of renewable generation into distribution networks is presenting a number of challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) including the provision of network access in capacity constrained networks. The introduction of Active Network Management (ANM) is enabling an increase in renewable generation connections through enhanced network access in otherwise \u2018full\u2019 networks. This paper presents a way in which DNOs might move towards Business as Usual (BAU) arrangements for ANM schemes. It is necessary to determine the curtailment arrangements, or Principles of Access (PoA), and from this estimate generation access under ANM and the flow of services and money for different scenarios. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review, detailed case study evaluation on early ANM schemes, quantitative curtailment assessment for different PoA and a qualitative analysis of business models for different ANM PoA is presented in turn with conclusions drawn from these three approaches.","title":"A review and analysis of renewable energy curtailment schemes and Principles of Access: transitioning towards business as usual","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"7","weight":0.0482,"docData":{"date":"26\/05\/19","money":"239","wordCount":"83","university":"A","abstract":"Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy has been proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the structure, dynamics and reactivity of electronically-excited states of inorganic molecules.

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx\u2019s work on fictitious capital.  Fictitious capital is any form of investment (for example bonds, stocks, derivatives, and collateralized debt obligations) which is based upon the expectation of future returns.  According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value \u2013 only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession\u2019s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.  The intuitional structures of accounting mean that it is susceptible of being captured by the most powerful in society.","title":"Accounting for the fictitious: a Marxist contribution to understanding accounting's roles in the financial crisis","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"478","weight":0.0452,"docData":{"date":"18\/01\/18","money":"633","wordCount":"133","university":"B","abstract":"The political ambition to turn Scotland into a low carbon economy, powered by renewable energy technologies, is driven, in part, by the belief that such a transformation will reindustrialise the country and generate tens of thousands of skilled jobs.

The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts.

Participants 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test result, as part of the national bowel screening programme, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomised to intervention and 166 to control. Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight. Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Differences between groups were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. Conclusions: Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening programme, offering considerable potential for risk reduction of disease in older adults.","title":"The impact of a bodyweight and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening programme: randomised controlled trial","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"73","weight":0.0417,"docData":{"date":"09\/12\/19","money":"978","wordCount":"24","university":"A","abstract":"The grounds of referral to the Children\u2019s Reporter are found under s67(2) of the new act.

Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0.07 m that was partly filled with foamed polyurethane. The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of \u201Cthe irreversible expansion of clay brick,\u201D apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers\u2019 comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.\n\nIrreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1\/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.\n\nThe persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a \u201Cpoor mortar\u201D to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1\/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).\n\nThe discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70\u2009kJ\/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.\n\nIt seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).","title":"Discussion of \u201CLearning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair\u201D by Paulo B.

We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.

We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.","title":"The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"546","weight":0.0341,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/19","money":"485","wordCount":"147","university":"B","abstract":"Recent progress in the field of genetic engineering has opened up the door to novel synthetic biology applications.

In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos.

Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.","title":"Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"776","weight":0.0329,"docData":{"date":"05\/12\/19","money":"550","wordCount":"213","university":"B","abstract":"Background: Pharmaceutical expenditure has grown by 16% per annum in China during the past decade. This has been enhanced by increased coverage as well as incentives to physicians and hospitals. Hospital pharmacies dispense 80% of medicines in China, with medicines currently accounting for 46% of total hospital expenditure. Hospitals currently rely on revenues from procurement of medicines for their sustainability. Principal measures to moderate growth in drug expenditure include initiatives to reduce procured drug prices. However, to date no formal pricing policies for generics in China similar to Europe and limited demand-side measures to enhance appropriate prescribing, e.g. no universal measures to monitor the quality of prescribing. Current incentives have led to irrationality in prescribing; e.g. high use of injectable drugs, antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) despite the development of essential medicine lists. Objective: Assess current utilisation and expenditure of CV medicines including TCMs between 2006 and 2012 and compare the findings with Western European countries. Methods: Uncontrolled retrospective study of prescriptions to treat cardio-vascular disease in one of the largest hospitals in Southwest China. Results: Utilisation of CV drugs increased 3.3 fold during the study period, greatest for TCMs. Procured expenditure increased 4.85 fold. Variable utilisation of generics at 29% to 31% of the total for each molecule in recent years among high volume pharmacotherapeutic products.  However, low prices for generics have been achieved through multiple supply-side measures, matching those achieved among some European countries. Continued irrationality in prescribing is seen with high use TCMs despite limited evidence and the utilisation of drugs dropping significantly once low prices procured. Conclusion: Prices still have appreciable impact on the subsequent utilization of different CV drugs in China. Consequently, there is appreciable potential to introduce measures similar to Western Europe to improve future rationality and reduce overall drug costs. This could include robust formularies, quality targets and financial incentives.

We examined videos from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) sub-cohort who attended the \u2018Children in Focus\u2019 clinic at one year of age. Our sample comprised 180 videos of parent-infant interaction: 60 from infants who received a psychiatric diagnostic categorisation at seven years and 120 randomly selected controls who were group-matched on sex. \nA negative association between positive interactions and oppositional\/conduct disorders was found. With the exception of pervasive developmental disorders (autism), an increase of one positive interaction per minute predicted a 15% (95% CI: 4% to 26%) reduction in the odds of the infant being case diagnosed. There was no statistically significant relationship between negative parenting interactions and oppositional\/conduct disorders, although negative interactions were rarely observed in this setting. \nThe Mellow Parenting Observation System, specifically low scores for positive parenting interactions (such as Responsiveness which encompasses parental warmth towards the infant), predicted later psychiatric diagnostic categorisation of oppositional\/conduct disorders.","title":"Association between parent-infant interactions in infancy and disruptive behaviour disorders at age seven: a nested case-control ALSPAC study","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"330","weight":0.0286,"docData":{"date":"29\/10\/15","money":"897","wordCount":"35","university":"B","abstract":"While headline figures on employment, the participation rate and the unemployment rate for the UK are encouraging, there is widespread agreement that the evolving changes in the labour market underlying these figures are more complex.

Specifically, the effect of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport is explored. The first investigation explores fast electron transport in allotropes of carbon by measuring the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of protons accelerated from the target rear-surface. An analytical model is developed which accounts for the rear-surface fast electron sheath dynamics, ionisation and projection of the resulting beam of protons, and is used (in conjunction with the experimental measurements) to infer annular fast electron beam transport with lamentary structure in 200 um-thick diamond targets. The important role that material lattice structure has in defining electrical resistivity, which in turn defines the fast electron transport properties, is established utilising three-dimensional hybrid pa rticle-in-cell (3D hybrid-PIC) simulations together with an analytical model of the resistive lamentation instability. The second investigation explores fast electron transport in silicon utilising both experimental measurements and 3D hybrid-PIC simulations. Annular fast electron transport is demonstrated and explained by resistively generated magnetic fields. The results indicate the potential to completely transform the beam transport pattern by tailoring the resistivity-temperature profile at temperatures as low as a few eV. Additionally, the sensitivity of annular fast electron beam transport is explored by varying the drive laser pulse parameters (i.e. energy, focal spot radius and pulse duration) and is found to be particularly sensitive to the peak laser pulse intensity. An ability to optically 'tune' the properties of an annular fast electron transport pattern may be important for applications. In the final investigation the effect that initial target temperature, and thus lattice melt, has on fast electron transport properties is demonstrated. Laser-accelerated proton beams are used to isochorically heat silicon for several tens-of-picoseconds prior to the propagation of fast electrons through the pre-heated target. This enables the influence of resistivity gradients, generated by proton-induced lattice melt, on fast electron transport properties to be explored. The experimental observation of an annular proton beam after t heat = 30 ps of proton pre-heating, which corresponds to annular electron transport within the target, is in excellent qualitative agreement with 3-D hybrid-PIC simulations of fast electron transport in a target containing an initial temperature (and thus, resistivity) gradient.","title":"Effects of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport in relativistic laser-solid interactions","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"23","weight":0.0268,"docData":{"date":"03\/11\/19","money":"966","wordCount":"112","university":"D","abstract":"Photovoltaic solar power generation is proven to be effective and sustainable but is currently hampered by relatively high costs and low conversion efficiency. This paper addresses both issues by presenting a low-cost and efficient temperature distribution analysis for identifying PV module mismatch faults by thermography. Mismatch faults reduce the power output and cause potential damage to PV cells. This paper firstly defines three fault categories in terms of fault levels, which lead to different terminal characteristics of the PV modules. The investigation of three faults is also conducted analytically and experimentally and maintenance suggestions are also provided for different fault types. The proposed methodology is developed to combine the electrical and thermal characteristics of PV cells subjected to different fault mechanisms through simulation and experimental tests. Furthermore, the fault diagnosis method can be incorporated into the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes to shift the operating point of the PV string. The developed technology has improved over the existing ones in locating the faulty cell by a thermal camera, providing a remedial measure and maximizing the power output under faulty conditions.","title":"Identifying PV module mismatch faults by a thermography-based temperature distribution analysis","authors":"I & J"}},{"docId":"493","weight":0.0264,"docData":{"date":"19\/11\/18","money":"385","wordCount":"152","university":"A","abstract":"Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for the treatment of adolescent obesity have taken place outside the western world.

The good practice intervention was intended as relatively low intensity (6 hours contact over 24 weeks, group-based), aiming to change sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet. The primary outcome was a change in body mass index (BMI) Z score; other outcomes were changes in waist circumference and blood pressure.  The retention of subjects to follow up was acceptable (n\u2009=\u200931 from the intervention group, and n\u2009=\u200932 from the control group), but engagement with both the intervention and control treatment was poor.

Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.","title":"Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"190","weight":0.0259,"docData":{"date":"20\/02\/19","money":"820","wordCount":"116","university":"B","abstract":"Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are expected to play a critical role in future energy grids.

In this paper we propose a system architecture that enables us to optimally size the ESS system according to the number of users. We model the demand of each customer by a two-state Markovian fluid and the aggregate demand of all users are multiplexed at the ESS. The proposed model also draws a constant power from the grid and it is used to accommodate the customer demand and charge the storage unit, if required. Then, given the population of customers and their stochastic demands, and the power drawn from the grid we provide an analytical solution for ESS sizing using the underflow probability as the main performance metric, which is defined as the percentage of time that the system resources fall short of demand.

Atomistic multi-tip diamond tool models were built with different tool geometries in terms of the difference in the tip cross-sectional shape, tip angle, and the feature of tool tip configuration, to determine their effect on the applied forces and the machined nano-groove geometries. The quality of machined nanostructures was characterized by the thickness of the deformed layers and the dimensional accuracy achieved. Simulation results show that diamond turning using nanoscale multi-tip tools offers tremendous shape transferability in machining nanostructures.

Vapour phase sampling was conducted using sampling tubes loaded with Tenax-TA™ and trapped analytes were determined using thermal desorption-gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The results of this study are presented in a simple \u2018decision tree\u2019 diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, chloronaphthalene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4,4\u2032-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol. Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4,4\u2032-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, chloronaphthalene and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS. Dichlorvos, HCH, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin were also trapped onto Tenax TA™ and qualitatively detected by TD-GC-MS. Although a key objective of the developed methods was non-invasive sampling, the low volatility of 4,4\u2032-DDT precluded it from vapour phase monitoring and hexane swabbing followed by HPLC analysis was required.","title":"Non-invasive multiresidue screening methods for the determination of pesticides in heritage collections","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"369","weight":0.0248,"docData":{"date":"02\/11\/16","money":"440","wordCount":"121","university":"A","abstract":"With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever.

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue.

We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability.

Once the software upgrades will be completed, the effectiveness of the different disposal strategies will be analyzed in terms of residual collision risk and avoidance maneuvers rate.","title":"Effectiveness of GNSS disposal strategies","authors":"B & L"}},{"docId":"245","weight":0.0129,"docData":{"date":"16\/01\/19","money":"763","wordCount":"78","university":"B","abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate the control of the light polarization emitted by a 1310 nm dilute nitride spin-Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) at room temperature.

Without external injection, the polarization of the optical pump controls that of the spin-VCSEL. However, the addition of the externally injected signal polarized with either left- (LCP) or rightcircular polarization (RCP) is able to control the polarization of the spin-VCSEL switching it at will to left- or right-circular polarization.

With the variety of options available it can be difficult to determine which type is most suitable for on and offshore applications. A large percentage of modern drive trains consist of either doubly fed induction generators with partially rated converters or permanent magnet generators with fully rated converters. These configurations were the focus of this empirical reliability comparison. The turbine population for the analysis contained over 1800 doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) turbines and 400 permanent magnet generator (PMG) fully rated converter (FRC) turbines. The findings of this analysis show that, due to the poorer reliability of the FRC, the DFIG configuration proved the most reliable.","title":"Reliability comparison of DFIG drive train configuration with PMG drive train configuration in the first 5 years of operation","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"284","weight":0.0124,"docData":{"date":"02\/04\/15","money":"404","wordCount":"81","university":"E","abstract":"Pure surface-tension-driven flow is a unique type of flow that can be controlled through external manipulation of thermal and\/or mechanical boundary conditions at the free liquid surface where the entire driving force for the convection is generated.

However, to date, these more critical electrical systems have not been accounted for in existing engine certification standards. To begin to address this gap, this paper conducts a review of current engine certification standards in order to determine how these standards will impact on the design requirements of More-Electric Engine (MEE) electrical system architectures. The paper focuses on determining two key architectural requirements: the number of individual failures an architecture can accommodate and still remain functional and the rate at which these failures are allowed to occur. The paper concludes by proposing a comprehensive set of design requirements for MEE electrical architectures, considering various operating strategies, and demonstrates their application to example MEE electrical system architecture designs.","title":"Impact of engine certification standards on the design requirements of More-Electric Engine electrical system architectures","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"380","weight":0.011,"docData":{"date":"08\/09\/16","money":"733","wordCount":"91","university":"A","abstract":"Data mining often causes privacy concerns. To ease the concerns, various privacy preserving data mining techniques have been proposed. However, those techniques are often too computationally intensive to be deployed in practice. Efficiency becomes a major challenge in privacy preserving data mining. In this paper we present an efficient secure dot product protocol and show its application in privacy preserving association rule mining, one of the most widely used data mining techniques. The protocol is orders of magnitude faster than previous protocols because it employs mostly cheap cryptographic operations, e.g. hashing and modular multiplication. The performance has been further improved by parallelization. We implemented the protocol and tested the performance. The test result shows that on moderate commodity hardware, the dot product of two vectors of size 1 million can be computed within 1 minute. As a comparison, the currently most widely used protocol needs about 1 hour and 23 minutes.","title":"A fast secure dot product protocol with application to privacy preserving association rule mining","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"60","weight":0.0109,"docData":{"date":"06\/07\/19","money":"269","wordCount":"92","university":"A","abstract":"Since nano-spacecraft are small, low cost and do not undergo the same rigor of\ntesting as conventional spacecraft, they have a greater risk of failure. In this paper we address the problem of attitude control of a nano-spacecraft that experiences different types of faults. Based on the traditional quaternion feedback control method, an adaptive fault-tolerant control method is developed, which can ensure that the control system still operates when the actuator fault happens. This paper derives the fault-tolerant control logic under both actuator gain fault mode and actuator deviation fault mode. Taking the parameters of the UKube-1 in the simulation model, a comparison between a traditional spacecraft control method and the adaptive fault-tolerant control method in the presence of a fault is undertaken. It is shown that the proposed controller copes with faults and is able to complete an effective attitude control manoeuver in the presence of a fault.","title":"An application of adaptive fault-tolerant control to nano-spacecraft","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"165","weight":0.0085,"docData":{"date":"22\/04\/17","money":"915","wordCount":"118","university":"D","abstract":"The 3-D Rankine source method is becoming a very popular method for the seakeeping problem, especially when marine vessels are travelling with forward speed. However, this method requires an accurate radiation condition to ensure that the waves propagate away from the ship. Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.","title":"A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed","authors":"E &

Recent experimental measurements of mass flow rates along a rectangular tube with large aspect ratio are compared with numerical results for the linearised Boltzmann equation. Then, a number of two-dimensional micro flows in the transition and free molecular flow regimes are simulated using the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. The influence of the molecular model is discussed, as well as the applicability of the linearised Boltzmann equation. For thermally driven flows in the free molecular regime, it is found that the magnitudes of the flow velocity are inversely proportional to the Knudsen number. The streamline patterns of thermal creep flow inside a closed\nrectangular channel are analysed in detail: when the Knudsen number is smaller than a critical value, the flow pattern can be predicted based on a linear superposition of the velocity profiles of linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep \nflows between parallel plates. For large Knudsen numbers, the flow pattern can be determined using the linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep velocity profiles at the critical Knudsen number.

By contrast, the wave number of the fastest growing mode does not show important variations with inertia. The numerical technique allows us to follow the evolution of the free surface instability until comparatively late stages, where the filament begins to break into droplets. The rupture pattern observed for several cases shows that the number of principal droplets agrees reasonably well with an estimation based on the fastest growing modes.","title":"The influence of inertia and contact angle on the instability of partially wetting liquid strips: a numerical analysis study","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"361","weight":0.5692,"docData":{"date":"08\/07\/19","money":"496","wordCount":"123","university":"D","abstract":"Variable angle tow (VAT) laminates have previously shown enhanced buckling performance compared to conventional straight fibre laminates. In this study, an analytical method is developed for the buckling analysis of a novel blade stiffened VAT panel to allow this potential to be more fully exploited. The prebuckling and buckling analysis, performed on a representative section of a blade stiffened VAT panel, are based on a generalised Rayleigh\u2013Ritz procedure. The buckling analysis includes a first order shear deformation theory by introducing additional shape functions for transverse shear and is therefore applicable to structures with thick skins relative to characteristic length. Modelling of the stiffener is achieved with two approaches; idealisation as a beam attached to the skin\u2019s midplane and as a rigidly attached plate. Comparing results with finite element analysis (Abaqus) for selected case studies, local buckling errors for the beam model and plate model were found to be less than 3% and 2% respectively, whilst the beam model error for global buckling was between 3% and 10%. The analytical model provides an accurate alternative to the computationally expensive finite element analysis and is therefore suitable for future work on the design and optimisation of stiffened VAT panels.","title":"Buckling analysis of stiffened variable angle tow panels","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"317","weight":0.5567,"docData":{"date":"22\/07\/19","money":"789","wordCount":"106","university":"B","abstract":"In this paper a fictitious domain method is used to study the motion of particles in a differentially heated cavity.

The motion of the particles in a differentially heated cavity is considered where the vertical walls are subject to a temperature difference δ. T whereas horizontal walls are assumed to be adiabatic. Depending on the fluid Grashof number different flow regimes and two critical Grashof numbers are identified. Sustained motion of the suspended particles is also studied and different behaviour is observed compared to the limiting case of tracer particles where simulations are usually performed using one-way coupled point-particle assumptions. Finally the effects of the particles on the heat transfer from the hot wall are studied and it is found that addition of large particles can adversely influence the heat transfer rate. However, if hot particles are effectively removed from the wall, e.g. by increasing the Grashof number, wall heat transfer properties can still be enhanced.","title":"Fully resolved simulation of particle deposition and heat transfer in a differentially heated cavity","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"596","weight":0.5556,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/18","money":"900","wordCount":"72","university":"B","abstract":"In this paper we present a general model of drug release from a drug delivery device and the subsequent drug transport in biological tissue.

However, this method requires an accurate radiation condition to ensure that the waves propagate away from the ship. Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.","title":"A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"534","weight":0.0556,"docData":{"date":"16\/07\/17","money":"198","wordCount":"108","university":"E","abstract":"This short paper introduces an enhancement to the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) by extending it with three new operators to describe interactions on mobile touchscreen devices.

Three prototypes were developed to serve as a test environment in which to validate Fitts\u2019s equations and estimate the parameters for these interactions. A total of 3090 observations were made with a total of 51 users. While the studies confirmed each interaction fitted well to Fitts\u2019s Law for most interactions, it was noticed that Fitts\u2019s Law does not fit well for interactions with an Index of Difficulty exceeding 4 bits, highlighting a possible maximum comfortable stretch. Based on results, the following approximate movement times for KLM are suggested: 70ms for a short untargeted swipe, 200ms for a half-screen sized zoom, and 80ms for an icon pointing from a home position. These results could be used by developers of mobile phone and tablet applications to describe tasks as a sequence of the operators used and to predict user interaction times prior to creating prototypes.","title":"Enhancing KLM (Keystroke-Level Model) to fit touch screen mobile devices","authors":"B & E"}},{"docId":"340","weight":0.0541,"docData":{"date":"22\/08\/16","money":"383","wordCount":"74","university":"A","abstract":"This paper describes a facile approach for the manufacture of capacitive transducers based on micropatterning of polymer substrates.

This subsequently influences the behavior of reinforced concrete structures in terms of their safety and serviceability. The present paper attempts to develop a numerical method that can simulate the behavior of reinforced concrete walls subjected to steel corrosion in concrete as measured by their load-deflection relationship. The method accounts for the effects of corrosion on the stiffness, maximum strength, residual strength, and failure mode of the bond between the steel and concrete. In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate. It is found in this paper that the increase in the bond strength due to minor corrosion can increase the load-bearing capacity of the wall and the corrosion-affected reinforced concrete walls exhibit less ductile behavior compared with the uncorroded walls. The paper concludes that the developed numerical method can predict the behavior of corrosion-affected reinforced concrete seawalls with reasonable accuracy.","title":"Numerical simulation of behavior of reinforced concrete structures considering corrosion effects on bonding","authors":"A & B & C & D"}},{"docId":"698","weight":0.0516,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/16","money":"632","wordCount":"97","university":"B","abstract":"This document describes the development of a full scale empirical validation dataset for building energy simulation tools.

PiC\ncode simulations have been undertaken to investigate the dynamics of the cyclotron emission process in the absence of cavity boundaries with particular consideration of the spatial growth rate, spectral output and rf conversion efficiency. Computations reveal that a well-defined cyclotron emission process occurs albeit with a low spatial growth rate compared to waveguide bounded simulations. The rf output is near perpendicular to the electron beam with a slight backward-wave character reflected in the spectral output with a well defined peak at 2.68GHz, just below the relativistic electron cyclotron frequency. The corresponding rf conversion efficiency of 1.1% is comparable to waveguide bounded simulations and consistent with the predictions of kinetic theory that suggest efficient, spectrally well defined radiation emission can be obtained from an electron horseshoe distribution in the absence of radiation boundaries.","title":"Numerical simulation of unconstrained cyclotron resonant maser emission","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"433","weight":0.05,"docData":{"date":"29\/06\/19","money":"428","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"Offshore wind power is becoming an important topic of the world's renewable energy research.

The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.\nTime-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.\nAn evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.\nSimilar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.\nLinear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.","title":"Impurity transport studies on MAST","authors":"B & C"}},{"docId":"213","weight":0.0397,"docData":{"date":"20\/04\/17","money":"252","wordCount":"126","university":"A","abstract":"Superplastic forming (SPF) is an advanced sheet manufacturing process typically restricted to low volume and high value products.

Suitable surface treatments have a remarkable effect on wear resistance; hence, the working surface of the die can be improved by the application of appropriate coatings, increasing the lifetime of the SPF ceramic dies. Thermal spray is a promising deposition method, since numerous coating solutions are achievable without expensive vacuum technology. This paper describes a method for the investigation of surface degradation mechanisms in ceramic dies during SPF process at laboratory scale. Greater emphasis is given to the application of thermal sprayed coatings and quantification of their protection properties. At the Advanced Forming Research Centre is been designed a dedicated test rig used for simulate the die part interface at SPF condition.

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect GWs emitted from merging binary black holes (BBH) and recover their parameters with next-generation GW observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.","title":"The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations","authors":"H & L"}},{"docId":"613","weight":0.0354,"docData":{"date":"22\/04\/15","money":"348","wordCount":"113","university":"A","abstract":"The present work aims to examine the strategic decision of future electricity generation mix considering, together with all other factors, the effect of the external cost associated with the available power generation technology options, not only during their operation but also during their whole life cycle.

The model has been applied for the case of Greece for the years 2012-2050 and has led to several interesting results. Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased. Summing-up, external cost has been found to be a significant percentage of the total electricity generation cost for some energy sources, therefore significantly changing the ranking order of cost-competitiveness for the energy sources examined.","title":"Incorporating life cycle external cost in optimization of the electricity generation mix","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"428","weight":0.0348,"docData":{"date":"06\/12\/16","money":"136","wordCount":"115","university":"E","abstract":"We show that arrays of emissive nanorod structures can exhibit strong photonic crystal behavior, via observations of the far-field luminescence from core-shell and quantum disc InGaN\/GaN nanorods. The conditions needed for the formation of directional Bloch modes characteristic of strong photonic behavior are found to depend critically upon the vertical shape of the nanorod sidewalls. Index guiding by a region of lower volume-averaged refractive index near the base of the nanorods creates a quasi-suspended photonic crystal slab at the top of the nanorods which supports Bloch modes. Only diffractive behavior could be observed without this region. Slab waveguide modelling of the vertical structure shows that the behavioral regime of the emissive nanorod arrays depends strongly upon the optical coupling between the nanorod region and the planar layers below. The controlled crossover between the two regimes of photonic crystal operation enables the design of photonic nanorod structures formed on planar substrates that exploit either behavior depending on device requirements.","title":"Strong photonic crystal behavior in regular arrays of core-shell and quantum disc InGaN\/GaN nanorod light-emitting diodes","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"521","weight":0.0331,"docData":{"date":"21\/02\/18","money":"739","wordCount":"121","university":"D","abstract":"The majority of methods of severe plastic deformation (SPD) used for producing ultra-fine grained (UFG) and nano materials involve the non-uniform distribution of strains in the workpiece. To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed.

The LCL-filter is nowadays the preferred solution as it allows lower inductance values. In order to solve the stability concerns, active damping is preferred to passive damping since it does not use dissipative elements. However, large variations in the grid inductance and resonances arising from parallel converters may still compromise the system stability. This calls for a robust design of LCL-filters with active damping. This paper proposes a design flow with little iteration for two well-known methods, namely lead-lag network and current capacitor feedback. The proposed formulas for the resonance frequency, grid and converter inductance ratio, and capacitance of the LCL-filter allow calculating all the LCL-filter parameters. An estimation for the achieved Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the grid current is also provided.

All these structures feature alternate layers of cations and of anions where any solvent is associated with the anion layers. The two sulfonate salts are protonated at the aniline N atom and the amide N atom of sulfadiazine, a tautomeric form of the sulfadiazine cation that has not been crystallographically described before. All the other salt forms are instead protonated at the aniline group and on one N atom of the pyrimidine ring. Whilst all eight species are based upon hydrogen-bonded centrosymetric dimers with graph set R22(8), the two sulfonate structures also differ in that these dimers do not link into one-dimensional chains of cations through NH3-to-SO2 hydrogen-bonding interactions, whilst the other six species do. The chloride methanol hemisolvate and the tetraiodide are isostructural and a packing analysis of the cation positions shows that the chloride monohydrate structure is also closely related to these.","title":"Eight salt forms of sulfadiazine","authors":"D & L"}},{"docId":"571","weight":0.7951,"docData":{"date":"27\/08\/15","money":"138","wordCount":"122","university":"C","abstract":"Background: Pharmaceutical expenditure has grown by 16% per annum in China, enhanced by incentives for physicians and hospitals.

This has been enhanced by increased coverage as well as incentives to physicians and hospitals. Hospital pharmacies dispense 80% of medicines in China, with medicines currently accounting for 46% of total hospital expenditure. Hospitals currently rely on revenues from procurement of medicines for their sustainability. Principal measures to moderate growth in drug expenditure include initiatives to reduce procured drug prices. However, to date no formal pricing policies for generics in China similar to Europe and limited demand-side measures to enhance appropriate prescribing, e.g. no universal measures to monitor the quality of prescribing. Current incentives have led to irrationality in prescribing; e.g. high use of injectable drugs, antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) despite the development of essential medicine lists. Objective: Assess current utilisation and expenditure of CV medicines including TCMs between 2006 and 2012 and compare the findings with Western European countries. Methods: Uncontrolled retrospective study of prescriptions to treat cardio-vascular disease in one of the largest hospitals in Southwest China. Results: Utilisation of CV drugs increased 3.3 fold during the study period, greatest for TCMs. Procured expenditure increased 4.85 fold. Variable utilisation of generics at 29% to 31% of the total for each molecule in recent years among high volume pharmacotherapeutic products.  However, low prices for generics have been achieved through multiple supply-side measures, matching those achieved among some European countries. Continued irrationality in prescribing is seen with high use TCMs despite limited evidence and the utilisation of drugs dropping significantly once low prices procured. Conclusion: Prices still have appreciable impact on the subsequent utilization of different CV drugs in China. Consequently, there is appreciable potential to introduce measures similar to Western Europe to improve future rationality and reduce overall drug costs. This could include robust formularies, quality targets and financial incentives. We are beginning to see improved rationality in the use of medicines with a reduction in TCMs. This will be monitored along with other suggestions to further enhance accessibility to medicines in China without prohibitive increases in pharmaceutical and overall expenditure.","title":"Initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China and their influence: cardio-cerebral vascular medicines as a case history to provide future direction","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"49","weight":0.715,"docData":{"date":"28\/11\/18","money":"914","wordCount":"214","university":"C","abstract":"Generic atypical antipsychotic drugs offer health authorities opportunities for considerable savings. However, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are complex diseases that require tailored treatments. Consequently, generally there have been limited demand-side measures by health authorities to encourage the preferential prescribing of generics. This is unlike the situation with hypertension, hypercholaesterolaemia or acid-related stomach disorders.The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the limited demand-side measures in Western European countries and regions on the subsequent prescribing of risperidone following generics; to utilise the findings to provide future guidance to health authorities; and where possible, to investigate the utilisation of generic versus originator risperidone and the prices for generic risperidone.\n\nPrincipally, this was a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series data of the effect of the various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).\n\nThere was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland. Similarly, the price of generic risperidone varied considerably. In Scotland, generic risperidone was only 16% of pre-patent loss prices versus 72% in Ireland.\n\nConsistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.","title":"Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? findings from across Europe and their implications","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"30","weight":0.68,"docData":{"date":"09\/09\/18","money":"270","wordCount":"125","university":"C","abstract":"Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is believed to be accompanied by increased activation of the sensory and motor cortices. Our knowledge on this interaction is based mainly on fMRI studies, but there is little direct evidence on how these changes manifest in terms of dynamic neuronal activity. This study reports on the presence of transient EEG based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyse dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronisation in the theta, alpha and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both non-painful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronisation during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.","title":"Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury","authors":"L & K & C"}},{"docId":"713","weight":0.6667,"docData":{"date":"28\/06\/18","money":"668","wordCount":"21","university":"A","abstract":"Isomorphisms φ : A −→ B between pattern classes are considered.

The quality of machined nanostructures was characterized by the thickness of the deformed layers and the dimensional accuracy achieved. Simulation results show that diamond turning using nanoscale multi-tip tools offers tremendous shape transferability in machining nanostructures. Both periodic and non-periodic nano-grooves with different cross-sectional shapes can be successfully fabricated using the multi-tip tools. A hypothesis of minimum designed ratio of tool tip distance to tip base width (L\/Wf) of the nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool for the high precision machining of nanostructures was proposed based on the analytical study of the quality of the nanostructures fabricated using different types of the multi-tip tools. Nanometric cutting trials using nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools (different in L\/Wf) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) were then conducted to verify the hypothesis. The investigations done in this work imply the potential of using the nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool for the deterministic fabrication of period and non-periodic nanostructures, which opens up the feasibility of using the process as a versatile manufacturing technique in nanotechnology.","title":"Investigation of the shape transferability of nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools in the diamond turning of nanostructures","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"417","weight":0.6364,"docData":{"date":"02\/09\/19","money":"657","wordCount":"44","university":"B","abstract":"This paper describes spatial and temporal distributions of bone loss in the paralysed limbs of patients  during their first year after spinal cord injury (SCI).

This process is associated with inflammation, bone loss and implant loosening and led to the withdrawal from the market of the DePuy ASR™ MoM hip replacements in 2010. Ions released from CoCr particles derived from a resurfacing implant in vitro and their subsequent cellular up-take were measured by ICP-MS. Moreover, the ability of such metal debris and Co ions to induce both apoptosis was evaluated with both FACS and immunoblotting. qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects on the expression of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG1), nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible (NOS2), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A). ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions. There was also an increase (p < 0.05) in apoptosis after a 48 h exposure to wear debris. Analysis of qRT-PCR results found significant up-regulation (p < 0.05) particularly of NOS2 and BAG1 in Co pre-treated cells which were subsequently exposed to Co ions + debris. Metal debris was more effective as an inducer of apoptosis and gene expression when cells had been pre-treated with Co ions. This suggests that if a patient receives sequential bilateral CoCr implants, the second implant may be more likely to produce adverse effects than the first one.","title":"CoCr wear particles generated from CoCr alloy metal-on-metal hip replacements, and cobalt ions stimulate apoptosis and expression of general toxicology-related genes in monocyte-like U937 cells","authors":"A & D"}},{"docId":"406","weight":0.5834,"docData":{"date":"01\/12\/18","money":"510","wordCount":"48","university":"D","abstract":"β(1, 0)-trees provide a convenient description of rooted non-separable planar maps.

The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.

The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population).

By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape.

On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments.

We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.","title":"Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering","authors":"L"}},{"docId":"227","weight":0.0143,"docData":{"date":"20\/03\/18","money":"843","wordCount":"211","university":"A","abstract":"To promote early rehabilitation of walking, gait training can start even when patients are on bed rest. Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or\/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.","title":"Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation","authors":"B & C &

Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed lambda-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F.  This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity.","title":"A relationally parametric model of dependent type theory","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"341","weight":0.8158,"docData":{"date":"26\/02\/16","money":"361","wordCount":"114","university":"D","abstract":"Invariance is of paramount importance in programming languages and in physics. In programming languages, John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields \"free\" theorems about programs just from their types.

Knowledge of conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems. For example, the conservation of energy is by Noether's theorem a consequence of a system's invariance under time-shifting.\n\nIn this paper, we link Reynolds' relational parametricity with Noether's theorem for deriving conserved quantities. We propose an extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms of their Lagrangians.

Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux. As underflow solids fraction is increased, thickeners operated at a specified aggregate densification rate (or equivalently at a fixed settling zone height) tend to approach a 'fully densified' suspension state (defined as a point at which the extent of aggregate densification ceases to change with time), with improved thickening performance.","title":"Effects of aggregate densification upon thickening of Kynchian suspensions","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"734","weight":0.5926,"docData":{"date":"27\/07\/15","money":"169","wordCount":"54","university":"E","abstract":"We present a paradigm for capturing the complementarity of two observables.

In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems.

The proposed method has been validated by an experimental study by comparing it with already existing ensemble methods and ELM techniques for ordinal regression, showing competitive results.","title":"Cost-sensitive adaboost algorithm for ordinal regression based on extreme learning machine","authors":"E"}},{"docId":"795","weight":0.2709,"docData":{"date":"09\/05\/18","money":"594","wordCount":"48","university":"A","abstract":"We investigate transverse symmetry-breaking instabilities emerging from the optomechanical coupling between light and the translational degrees of freedom of a collisionless, damping-free gas of cold, two-level atoms.

However, it suffers from interference terms such as noise and non-overlapped regions. In this paper, a novel variant of the phase correlation approach is proposed, in which 2-D translation is estimated by projection-based subspace phase correlation (SPC). Conventional wisdom has suggested that such an approach can only amount to a compromise solution between accuracy and efficiency. In this work, however, we prove that the original SPC and the further introduced gradient-based SPC can provide robust solution to zero-mean and non-zero-mean noise, and the latter is also used to model the interference term of non-overlapped regions. Comprehensive results from synthetic data and MRI images have fully validated our methodology. Due to its substantially lower computational complexity, the proposed method offers additional advantages in terms of efficiency and can lend itself to very fast implementations for a wide range of applications where speed is at a premium.","title":"Gradient-based subspace phase correlation for fast and effective image alignment","authors":"H & J"}},{"docId":"726","weight":0.1429,"docData":{"date":"26\/09\/18","money":"558","wordCount":"35","university":"B","abstract":"The field of optomechanics deals with the mutual coupling of light and matter via optical forces.

The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.","title":"An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"152","weight":0.0764,"docData":{"date":"15\/08\/16","money":"116","wordCount":"131","university":"D","abstract":"Biomimetic compounds based upon the active subsite of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme system have been the focus of much attention as catalysts for hydrogen production: a clean energy vector.

Here, we report ultrafast UVpump\u2013IRprobe spectroscopy of 1 at three different excitation wavelengths and in a range of solvents, including under the conditions required for H2 production. Combining spectroscopic measurements of the photochemistry and vibrational relaxation dynamics of 1 with ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that, irrespective of experimental conditions, near-instantaneous carbonyl ligand loss is the main photochemical channel. No evidence for a long-lived excited electronic state was found. These results provide the first time-resolved data for the photochemistry of 1 and offer an alternative interpretation of the underlying mechanism of light-driven hydrogen generation.","title":"Investigation of the ultrafast dynamics occurring during unsensitized photocatalytic H2 evolution by an [FeFe]-hydrogenase subsite analogue","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"711","weight":0.0732,"docData":{"date":"03\/03\/19","money":"619","wordCount":"41","university":"D","abstract":"Single DNA-nanoparticle binding is used to couple the plasmonic fields of nanophotonic bowtie dimers.

In this paper, a station-keeping algorithm based on the orbital lifetime expectancy is proposed for so-called quasi-periodic solutions. The method introduced is based on the identification of a manoeuvre maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach.

We demonstrate the propulsion of particles based on catalytically controlled molecular self-assembly and fiber formation at the particle surface. Specifically, phosphatase enzymes (acting as the engine) are conjugated to a quantum dot (the vehicle), and are subsequently exposed to micellar aggregates (fuel) that upon biocatalytic dephosphorylation undergo fibrillar self-assembly, which in turn causes propulsion. The motion of individual enzyme\/quantum dot conjugates is followed directly using fluorescence microscopy. While overall movement remains random, the enzymeconjugates exhibit significantly faster transport in the presence of the fiber forming system, compared to controls without fuel, a non-self-assembling substrate, or a substrate which assembles into spherical, rather than fibrous structures upon enzymatic dephosphorylation.

However, large variations in the grid inductance and resonances arising from parallel converters may still compromise the system stability. This calls for a robust design of LCL-filters with active damping. This paper proposes a design flow with little iteration for two well-known methods, namely lead-lag network and current capacitor feedback. The proposed formulas for the resonance frequency, grid and converter inductance ratio, and capacitance of the LCL-filter allow calculating all the LCL-filter parameters.

Poor usability can present a significant problem for older adults where accessing services and social activities are concerned, both of which have implications for exclusion. In a study of mobile text entry where we aimed to develop novel keyboard layouts to address the particular requirements of this group of users we employed a variety of participatory design techniques.

It suggests the importance of a socio-cultural context for understanding and addressing stigma, influenced by both social and cultural causal factors, including fear, past trauma, isolation, racism and the stress of the asylum process coupled with negative cultural beliefs about mental health problems.

The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.","title":"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws?

In 2013 our survey was conducted online, as far as possible, using the LimeSurvey software (http:\/\/www.limesurvey.org\/ ) for the first time. This was repeated in 2014.\nIn 2013, 300 participants were selected from 1094 possible participants, of whom 218 (73%) had email contact details. Postal questionnaires were used for the others, those whose email failed or where there were technical problems: 94 questionnaires were posted and 3 sent electronically for postal return.  Analysis of the 2012-2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56.5% experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31.6% (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19.3% for the postal respondents and a much higher 36.6% for the online respondents. This difference is highly significant (Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0.0001297).  Eleven (50%) of the 22 postal respondents and 50 (58.1%) of the 86 online respondents with valid loss data experienced losses, though this difference was not significant. The profile of the beekeepers differed between the two groups: the postal respondents were typically much more experienced beekeepers than the online respondents. It is therefore important for us to include the postal element for beekeepers not contactable by email, even though the response rate for the online survey was higher (65% online; 36% postal; 55% overall). \nIn the 2014 survey, 350 participants were chosen randomly from 1224 possible participants, 273 (78%) had email contact details, and 95 questionnaires were posted, allowing for 17 failing emails and one person with difficulty accessing the survey. \nPreliminary results, based on 118 valid responses collected so far in LimeSurvey from beekeepers, are that 41 (34.7%) experienced losses over winter 2013-14, and that the loss rate was 13.2% (74 colonies lost from 560 wintered colonies).  The final loss rates including postal responses may be expected to be lower.\nThe 2012-13 winter loss rate of 31.6% was the highest since our surveys began, the next highest being 30.9% over winter 2009-10. It seems likely that the much lower loss rate this last winter can largely be attributed to the different weather conditions.","title":"Colony loss monitoring surveys in Scotland: winter loss rates and the online versus postal approach","authors":"G & H"}},{"docId":"632","weight":0.7,"docData":{"date":"15\/06\/19","money":"920","wordCount":"100","university":"E","abstract":"Previous research indicates that residents\u2019 perceptions of their neighbourhoods can have an adverse influence on their health and wellbeing over and above the influence of structural disadvantage. Contrary to most prior research, this study employed an indicator of positive wellbeing and assessed the impact of individual characteristics, perceived social and environmental incivilities, indicators of cognitive and structural social capital, and perceived safety. Analyses of data from a large regional UK representative study (n=8237; 69.64% response rate), obtained using computer assisted software in the respondents\u2019 own homes, found the most influential determinants of wellbeing were physical health problems, age, SES and cognitive social capital. This suggests that the promotion of positive mental health within communities may benefit from efforts to foster a greater sense of belonging among residents. Environmental and social incivilities also appear to play a role in shaping wellbeing, thus interventions to improve local environments can help to play a part.","title":"The relative influence of neighbourhood incivilities, cognitive social capital, club membership and individual characteristics on positive mental health","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"248","weight":0.6799,"docData":{"date":"24\/08\/19","money":"263","wordCount":"456","university":"E","abstract":"Glasgow is Scotland\u2019s largest city and since 2009 it has seen stagnating levels of fixed broadband uptake (Ofcom, 2013). As recently as August 2013, Ofcom reported that fixed broadband uptake in Glasgow remained at 50%; this is significantly below the Scottish average of 68% (Ofcom, 2013). As the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 agenda of the United Kingdom government, which places government services online, becomes ever more pervasive this becomes a more pressing issue for the city. That needs to find ways to increase broadband adoption. There is also a need to uncover the deep seated reasons why there has been no improvement in fixed broadband uptake in the last five years in Glasgow. Internet access is lowest amongst the most deprived in society and those with the lowest incomes (SHS, 2012). Analysis based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation highlights that \u2018income deprivation in Glasgow City is greater than in Scotland as a whole\u2019- 21.5% of Glasgow\u2019s population were income deprived in 2012 (Scottish Government, 2012a, p3).\nThis paper focuses on the deprived areas of Glasgow and whether and how the most disadvantaged in the city use the Internet. The analysis draws on data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and from individuals in deprived areas. This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:\n In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?\n Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?\n What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?\nThe attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.\nSince geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to\n2\nhow they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.\nThere are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.\nThis paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.\nThe second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.\nThis paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities. There are multiple organisations which could assist in addressing the diverse needs of communities in increasing Internet access. However, they will need to work together and be responsive to the diverse needs of these communities. The evidence also provides direction for Glasgow City Council on ways to engage the disconnected, move forward with their Digital Strategy and close the Digital chasm that exists in the city.","title":"Internet access among the most income deprived: the case of Glasgow","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"423","weight":0.678,"docData":{"date":"23\/06\/19","money":"286","wordCount":"59","university":"D","abstract":"STV is often extolled because it allows voters to express a nuanced choice, but is criticised for being too confusing.

A workers\u2019 success in the ET is by no means the end of the story when it comes to achieving justice for a wrongdoing against them in the workplace. Enforcing an award made by an ET can itself be highly problematic . 1 The data presented in this report were collected as part of a European Research Council funded project entitled Citizens Advice Bureaux and Employment Disputes . 2 The overall aim of this project was to understand workers\u2019 experiences as they attempted to resolve problems faced at work, including identifying potential barriers to justice. Our particular focus was on workers who could not easily afford the services of a solicitor. As such, participants were recruited through Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) who are a key provider of employment advice to this group. We tracked the experiences of workers as they sought to resolve their workplace disputes \u2013 from their initial advice sessions with CABx to the closure ( or in some cases abandonment ) of the problem. The vast majority of our participants who pursued their claims in the ET did so prior to the introduction of fees on 29 July 2013. The report focuses on the paths taken and overall outcomes for participants who were successful with their claim in the ET. It begins by providing a brief overview of the system for enforcing ET awards. The key findings from our participant group are then presented in three sections : firstly, a summary of the outcomes of our participants; secondly, experiences of those who took formal action to enforce their ET awards; and, thirdly, experiences of those who did not take formal action to enforce their ET awards.

In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study conducted with recently migrated Eastern European children and their parents, reporting on their experiences of accessing health services post-migration. Unlike the case of adults, the experiences of newly migrated children have rarely been explored in relation to health services. We pay particular attention to three key areas: (1) migrant families׳ views of health service provision; (2) barriers to health service use; and (3) transnational use of health services. By using a social capital approach, we show how concerns about the Scottish health care practices enacted by migrant parents are adopted by children and are likely to impact on families׳ health beliefs and behaviours. The study highlights the important role of migrants׳ active participation as users of health services. We conclude that appropriate health services need to consider more carefully migrants׳ expectations and complex health care activities, in order to be fully inclusive and patient-centred.","title":"'I think that Polish doctors are better': experiences with and views of health services in Scotland among newly arrived migrant children and their parents","authors":"I & C & M"}},{"docId":"312","weight":0.5348,"docData":{"date":"22\/12\/17","money":"372","wordCount":"187","university":"E","abstract":"The focus is on the protracted dispute (2009 - 2011) between British Airways (BA) and its cabin crew and their union BASSA (British Airlines\u2019 Stewards and Stewardesses Association). Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company\u2019s imposition, in disregard of collective bargaining procedures, of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new \u2018mixed fleet\u2019 on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a \u2018strategy of decapitation\u2019 of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA\u2019s and crews\u2019 utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a \u2018distributed discourse\u2019 and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions\u2019 ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA\u2019s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.","title":"Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment","authors":"D"}},{"docId":"773","weight":0.5,"docData":{"date":"08\/07\/15","money":"992","wordCount":"204","university":"A","abstract":"Background: Technological innovations have the potential to strengthen human resources for health and improve access and quality of care in challenging 'post-conflict' contexts. However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.","title":"Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers","authors":"C"}},{"docId":"323","weight":0.4676,"docData":{"date":"22\/02\/15","money":"122","wordCount":"77","university":"C","abstract":"Peek, the Portable Eye Examination Kit, leverages smartphone technology to provide a range of ophthalmic diagnostic tests in low-income settings, thus empowering health workers to diagnose eye diseases and to manage and monitor patients within the community.

But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal\/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and\/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","authors":"F & K"}},{"docId":"419","weight":0.426,"docData":{"date":"12\/09\/17","money":"235","wordCount":"54","university":"C","abstract":"A low-cost alternative to the direct ophthalmoscope, a simple optical adapter for a smartphone, is described.

This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.","title":"Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology","authors":"A & G"}},{"docId":"767","weight":0.378,"docData":{"date":"25\/10\/15","money":"302","wordCount":"172","university":"C","abstract":"The Active Healthy Kids Canada (AHKC) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth has been effective in powering the movement to get kids moving by influencing priorities, policies, and practice in Canada. The AHKC Report Card process was replicated in 14 additional countries from 5 continents using 9 common indicators (Overall Physical Activity, Organized Sport Participation, Active Play, Active Transportation, Sedentary Behavior, Family and Peers, School, Community and Built Environment, and Government Strategies and Investments), a harmonized process and a standardized grading framework. The 15 Report Cards were presented at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children in Toronto on May 20, 2014. The consolidated findings are summarized here in the form of a global matrix of grades. There is a large spread in grades across countries for most indicators. Countries that lead in certain indicators lag in others. Overall, the grades for indicators of physical activity (PA) around the world are low\/poor. Many countries have insufficient information to assign a grade, particularly for the Active Play and Family and Peers indicators. Grades for Sedentary Behaviors are, in general, better in low income countries. The Community and Built Environment indicator received high grades in high income countries and notably lower grades in low income countries. There was a pattern of higher PA and lower sedentary behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower PA and higher sedentary behavior in countries reporting better infrastructure, which presents an interesting paradox. Many surveillance and research\ngaps and weaknesses were apparent. International cooperation and cross-fertilization is encouraged to tackle existing challenges, understand underlying mechanisms, derive innovative solutions, and overcome the expanding childhood inactivity crisis.","title":"Physical activity of children: a global matrix of grades comparing 15 countries","authors":"M & I"}},{"docId":"729","weight":0.367,"docData":{"date":"17\/01\/18","money":"359","wordCount":"109","university":"A","abstract":"Despite increasing policy emphasis on developing and retaining an aging workforce, this paper demonstrates employer use of electronic performance monitoring (EPM) as part of performance management which can adversely affect older workers. We focus specifically on the use of EPM which is used to identify a proportion of the workforce as \u2018underperformers', often referred to as forced distribution rating systems. Evidence is presented from union informants representing employees in two technologically-intensive service sectors: the financial sector and telecommunications. These sectors were amongst the first to utilize technology in a way which had transformative implications for work processes and people management in white-collar service work. In both sectors and across clerical and engineering work contexts, the data show the use of EPM by managers to guide punitive performance management for sickness absence and perceived reduced capability. Older workers emerge as a vulnerable group, with manager decisions shown to be based on age stereotypes. We argue that increasingly pervasive use of digitized performance monitoring may intensify age discrimination in performance management.","title":"'Decommissioned vessels' \u2013 performance management and older workers in technologically-intensive service work","authors":"E & A"}},{"docId":"72","weight":0.3627,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/15","money":"203","wordCount":"91","university":"E","abstract":"Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013) was the United Kingdom's prime minister from 1979 to 1990. Her informal transatlantic alliance with U.S. President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989 played an important role in the promotion of an international neoliberal policy agenda that remains influential today. Her critique of UK social democracy during the 1970s and her adoption of key neoliberal strategies, such as financial deregulation, trade liberalization, and the privatization of public goods and services, were popularly labeled Thatcherism. In this article, we consider the nature of Thatcherism and its impact on health and well-being during her period as prime minister and, to a lesser extent, in the years that follow; we focus mainly on Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments. In addition, her public-sector reforms applied business principles to the welfare state and prepared the National Health Service for subsequent privatization.","title":"The impact of Thatcherism on health and well-being in Britain","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"335","weight":0.3375,"docData":{"date":"02\/02\/16","money":"543","wordCount":"80","university":"A","abstract":"In recent years, usage of social media websites have been soaring.

Four broad strategies are considered: Prohibition, Laissez-faire, Restriction, and Constructive use. Possible consequences of each strategy are outlined and it is proposed that Constructive use should be the strategy of choice. Reasons in favour of a constructive orientation include the benefits of joint engagement, enjoyment, cognitive and perceptual challenges and social motivation; effective uses can support educational attainment in young people with language impairments. Some areas where children and young people with language impairments need support with new media are noted.

How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.\nThe study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011\u201312, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.\nChildren in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.\nThe EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.","title":"Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice","authors":"M & A"}},{"docId":"170","weight":0.1352,"docData":{"date":"10\/05\/18","money":"476","wordCount":"74","university":"B","abstract":"Oriented collapse of columns, large-scale destruction debris and temporary abandonment of the area deduced from an archaeological excavation provide evidence for a major (intensity IX) earthquake in Patras, Greece.

This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech.

Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines.

This resistance was carried further by the Scottish Covenanters fighting and winning the Bishops\u2019 Wars in 1639-40 and then exporting their revolution through armed intervention in Ireland from 1642 and in England from 1644. The Scottish Covenanters\u2019 alliance with the English Parliamentarians was formalised by the Solemn League and Covenant which again sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy throughout the three Stuart kingdoms. But these events cannot be viewed solely as British and Irish Civil Wars. They must be contextualised in relation to the Thirty Years War and particularly to the determination of France under both Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin to supplant the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs as the foremost European power. While much work has recently been done on the diplomatic links of the principal protagonists in the Civil Wars, the importance of France to Scottish Covenanters, English Parliamentarians and Irish Confederates in their tangled and tortuous relationships among themselves and with Charles I remains relatively underworked. This article does not attempt a comprehensive review, but sketches out the intricacies of Covenanting exchanges with the French Court before all prospects of a revived \u2018auld alliance\u2019 were crushed by the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell and his English regicides in 1651.","title":"Covenanting exchanges with the French court during the wars for the three kingdoms","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"634","weight":0.0646,"docData":{"date":"23\/05\/17","money":"933","wordCount":"124","university":"B","abstract":"Estimation of the long-term health effects of air pollution is a challenging task, especially when modeling spatial small-area disease incidence data in an ecological study design. The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.","title":"A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution","authors":"A"}},{"docId":"57","weight":0.0646,"docData":{"date":"13\/11\/15","money":"248","wordCount":"93","university":"B","abstract":"Graduates from higher education often enter the labour market with a considerable amount of work experience.

Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme. Even though field-related and voluntary work experience helps graduates to realize a fast integration into the labour market, it is not linked to higher chances for entering a favourable class position or to higher wages in the long run.

These conditions are poorly reported in the literature for safety valves. This paper presents a study where the ability of established two phase multi-dimensional modelling approaches to predict such conditions are investigated. Comparison with the simplified mixture model will show that this model tends to underestimate mass flowrates for medium to high liquid mass fraction.

It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a \"formally-defined pseudo-code\", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language.

An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by blaNDM-1 genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and blaNDM-1 genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about blaNDM-1 levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May\/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG) and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1 levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 ± 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 ± 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg-1)) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were very low across all sites (2.1 ± 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1)) in February in the Upper Ganges and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1 levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February and blaNDM-1 levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r=0.61; p=0.007). Given waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar; data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible \"hot spots\" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.","title":"Increased waterborne blaNDM-1 resistance gene abundances associated with seasonal human pilgrimages to the Upper Ganges River","authors":"E & F"}},{"docId":"514","weight":0.0282,"docData":{"date":"28\/11\/15","money":"370","wordCount":"71","university":"B","abstract":"The paper presents an overview and analysis of company acquisition activity in Scotland over the period 2003-12.

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","title":"Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective","authors":"F & L & B"}},{"docId":"153","weight":0.0244,"docData":{"date":"21\/10\/19","money":"358","wordCount":"82","university":"A","abstract":"Concentrating optics are integrated into up-conversion photovoltaic (UC-PV) devices to independently concentrate sub-band-gap photons on the up-conversion layer, without affecting the full solar concentration on the overlying solar cell.
